# Terms of use

By registering to upload materials to PyPI, I agree and affirmatively
acknowledge the following:

* "Content" means any data, content, code, video, images or other materials of
  any type that I upload, submit, or otherwise transmit to or through PyPI.
  Acceptable Content is restricted to Python packages and related information.

* Any Content uploaded to PyPI is provided on a non-confidential basis, and is
  not a trade secret.

* I retain all right, title, and interest in the Content (to the same extent I
  possessed such right, title and interest prior to uploading the Content), but
  by uploading I grant or warrant (as further set forth below) that the PSF is
  free to disseminate the Content, in the form provided to the PSF.
  Specifically, that means:

  * If I upload Content covered by a royalty-free license included with such
    Content, giving the PSF the right to copy and redistribute such Content
    unmodified on PyPI as I have uploaded it, with no further action required
    by the PSF (an "Included License"), I represent and warrant that the
    uploaded Content meets all the requirements necessary for free
    redistribution by the PSF and any mirroring facility, public or private,
    under the Included License.

  * If I upload Content other than under an Included License, then I grant the
    PSF and all other users of the web site an irrevocable, worldwide,
    royalty-free, nonexclusive license to reproduce, distribute, transmit,
    display, perform, and publish the Content, including in digital form.

* For the avoidance of doubt, my warranty or license as set forth above applies
  to the Content exactly in the form provided to the PSF, and does not, other
  than as may be provided in the Included License, grant the PSF or any users
  of the website a license to make or distribute derivative works based on my
  Content.

* I further warrant that I do not know of any applicable unlicensed patent or
  trademark rights that would be infringed by my uploaded Content.

I represent and warrant that I have complied with all government regulations
concerning the transfer or export of any Content I upload to PyPI.  In
particular, if I am subject to United States law, I represent and warrant that
I have obtained any required governmental authorization for the export of the
Content I upload. I further affirm that any Content I provide is not intended
for use by a government end-user engaged in the manufacture or distribution of
items or services controlled on the Wassenaar Munitions List as defined in part
772 of the United States Export Administration Regulations, or by any other
embargoed user.
