Warehouse
=========

Warehouse is a next generation Python Package Repository designed to replace
the legacy code base that currently powers `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/>`_
(whose source code `lives on Github <https://github.com/pypa/pypi-legacy/>`_).

You can find more information in the `documentation`_.

Getting Started
---------------

You can run Warehouse locally using ``docker`` and ``docker-compose``. See
`Getting started <https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/development/getting-started/>`__
in the documentation for instructions on how to set it up.

Discussion
----------

If you run into bugs, you can file them in our `issue tracker`_.

You can also join ``#pypa`` or ``#pypa-dev`` on Freenode to ask questions or
get involved.
