Warehouse
=========

Warehouse is the software that powers `PyPI`_.
See `our development roadmap`_, `documentation`_, and
`architectural overview`_.

Getting Started
---------------

You can run Warehouse locally in a development environment using
``docker``. See `Getting started`_
documentation for instructions on how to set it up.

The canonical deployment of Warehouse is in production at `pypi.org`_.

Discussion
----------


You can find help or get involved on:

- `Github issue tracker`_ for reporting issues
- IRC: on `Libera`_, channel ``#pypa`` for general packaging discussion
  and user support, and ``#pypa-dev`` for
  discussions about development of packaging tools
- The `PyPA Discord`_ for live discussions
- The Packaging category on `Discourse`_ for discussing
  new ideas and community initiatives


Testing
----------

Read the `running tests and linters section`_ of our documentation to
learn how to test your code.  For cross-browser testing, we use an
open source account from `BrowserStack`_. If your pull request makes
any change to the user interface, it will need to be tested to confirm
it works in our `supported browsers`_.
