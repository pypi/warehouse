Warehouse
=========

Warehouse is a next-generation Python Package Repository designed to
replace the legacy code base that currently powers `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/>`_ (whose source code `lives on GitHub
<https://github.com/pypa/pypi-legacy/>`_). See `our development
roadmap`_.

You can find more information in the `documentation`_.

Getting Started
---------------

You can run Warehouse locally using ``docker`` and ``docker-compose``. See
`Getting started <https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/development/getting-started/>`__
in the documentation for instructions on how to set it up.

You can try a pre-production deployment of Warehouse at `pypi.org`_.

Discussion
----------

If you run into bugs, you can file them in our `issue tracker`_.

You can also file specific types of issues:

- `Good First Issue`_: An easy issue reserved for people who haven't
  contributed before
- `Visual Design Issue`_: An issue related to the visual design of the site

You can also join ``#pypa`` or ``#pypa-dev`` `on Freenode`_, or the
`pypa-dev mailing list`_, to ask questions or get involved.
