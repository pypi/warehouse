Warehouse
=========

Warehouse is the software that powers `PyPI`_.
See `our development roadmap`_, `documentation`_, and
`architectural overview`_.

Getting Started
---------------

You can run Warehouse locally in a development environment using
``docker`` and ``docker-compose``. See `Getting started`_
documentation for instructions on how to set it up.

The canonical deployment of Warehouse is in production at `pypi.org`_.

Discussion
----------

If you run into bugs, you can file them in our `issue tracker`_.

You can also join the chat channels ``#pypa`` (general packaging
discussion and user support) and ``#pypa-dev`` (discussion about
development of packaging tools) `on Freenode`_, or the `distutils-sig mailing
list`_, to ask questions or get involved.

Testing
----------

Read the `running tests and linters section`_ of our documentation to
learn how to test your code.  For cross-browser testing, we use an
open source account from `BrowserStack`_. If your pull request makes
any change to the user interface, it will need to be tested to confirm
it works in our `supported browsers`_.
