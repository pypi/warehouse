Warehouse is a next generation Python Package Repository designed to replace
the legacy code base that currently powers `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/>`_.

You can find more information in the `documentation`_.

Getting Started
---------------

Running a copy of Warehouse locally requires using ``docker`` and
``docker-compose``. Assuming you have those two items, here are a number of
commands you can use:

.. code-block:: console

    $ # Start up a local environment
    $ make serve
    $ # Start up a local environment in debug mode (pdb enabled)
    $ make debug
    $ # Initialize the database and fill it with test data
    $ make initdb
    $ # Run the tests
    $ make tests
    $ # Build the documentation
    $ make docs
    $ # Run the various linters
    $ make lint

.. note:: reCaptcha is featured in authentication and registration pages. To
          enable it, pass ``RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`` and ``RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY``
          through to ``serve`` and ``debug`` targets.


Discussion
----------

If you run into bugs, you can file them in our `issue tracker`_.

You can also join ``#pypa`` or ``#pypa-dev`` on Freenode to ask questions or
get involved.
