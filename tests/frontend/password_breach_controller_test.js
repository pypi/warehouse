    This does not feel good right now, but will allow progress.

    Due to some misbheavior between jest, stimulus, debounce, and jest-fetch-mock
    the mocked debounce function in `tests/frontend/__mocks__/debounce.js` is
    not getting debounced during these tests.

    When each test runs, the Controller is set up, and the `debounce` function
    is called at least 3 times before calling `fetch.resetMocks()`. This can be
    observed by adding a `console.log()` statement inside `debounce.js` mock.
    It's also unclear if using our mock debounce actually helps - removing it
    provides the same behaviors. But that's not the main issue here.

    Reports of `resetMocks()` not emptying out the mocks is the same as I'm
    seeing here. The only "easy" way I can see solving this for now is to
    increment the call count, which is brittle at best.
    I've even tried upgrading, same behavior on 3.0.3 - no change.
    See: https://github.com/jefflau/jest-fetch-mock/issues/78

    ----

    We're on Stimulus 1.x, and they have already progressed to 3.x - we should
    explore upgrading to a newer version of Stimulus and continue to debug the

    **test** behaviors - the production behavior works fine right now.
    Potentially: https://stimulus-use.github.io/stimulus-use/#/use-debounce
    See also: https://buddyreno.dev/posts/testing-stimulus-connect-in-jest
    
    Another approach is to stop mocking `fetch` at all, and try one of the
    approaches as shown in https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch
    This seems a bit advanced for me right now, but wanted to keep the link.
