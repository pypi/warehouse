Warehouse is a new code base that implements a `Python package index
(repository)`_.  It is being `actively developed`_ and will eventually
power PyPI_ and replace an older code base that is currently powering
PyPI.  You can see Warehouse in production at https://pypi.org/ and
you can read the `Warehouse roadmap`_.

The goal is to improve PyPI by making it:

- be more user-friendly
- have a more modern look
- have more features
- remove legacy APIs
- have more maintainable code with test coverage, docs, etc.
