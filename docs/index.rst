Warehouse is a `web application`_ that implements the canonical
`Python package index (repository)`_; its production deployment is
PyPI_. It replaces an older code base that powered pypi.python.org.

The goal is to improve PyPI by making it:

- be more user-friendly
- have a more modern look
- have more features
- remove legacy APIs
- have more maintainable code with test coverage, docs, etc.
