Warehouse is a new code base that implements a Python package repository.
It is being actively developed and
the plan is that it will eventually power PyPI_ and
replace an older code base that is currently powering PyPI.
You can see Warehouse in production at https://pypi.org/

The goal is to improve PyPI by making it:

- be more user-friendly
- have a more modern look
- more features
- remove legacy APIs
- have more maintainable code with test coverage, docs, etc.
