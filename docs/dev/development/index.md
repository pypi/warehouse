# Development

Warehouse, as an open-source project, welcomes contributions of all forms. The
sections below will help you get started with development, testing, and
documentation.

Please contribute issues, submit bug reports, and file feature requests on our
issue tracker on [GitHub](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse). If submitting a bug report for the first time,
check out ["What to put in your bug report"](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#what-to-put-in-your-bug-report) for guidance.

!!! warning "Security Issues"
    We take security very seriously. As such, security issues should
    be emailed to the maintainers instead of being submitted on the
    GitHub issue tracker. Read the [Security](../security/index.md) documentation for
    details.
