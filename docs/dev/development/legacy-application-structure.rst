Legacy Application URL Structure
================================

Note: this is a brain dump, mostly written by Donald Stufft in early 2015.

It *just* lists the legacy structure and none of the intended new structure.

The following documents the current URLs in the legacy PyPI application.

============= =================================================================
URL           Purpose
------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
/             Redirect to /pypi
/pypi         Legacy PyPI application. See below.
/daytime      Legacy mirroring support
/security     Page giving contact and other information regarding site security
/id           OpenID endpoint
/oauth        OAuth endpoint
/simple       Simple API as given in :doc:`../api-reference/legacy`
/packages     Serve up a package file
/mirrors      Page listing legacy mirrors (not to be retained)
/serversig    Legacy mirroring support (no-one uses it: not to be retained)
/raw-packages nginx implementation specific hackery (entirely internal; not to
              be retained)
/stats        Web stats. Whatever. Probably dead.
/local-stats  Package download stats. All the legacy mirrors have this.
/static       Static files (CSS, images) in support of the web interface.
============= =================================================================

The legacy application has a bunch of different behaviours:

1. With no additional path, parameter or content-type information the app
   renders a "front page" for the site. TODO: keep this behaviour or redirect?
2. With a content-type of "text/xml" the app runs in an XML-RPC server mode.
3. With certain path information the app will render project information.
4. With an :action parameter the app will take certain actions and/or display
   certain information.

The :action parameters are typically submitted through GET URL parameters,
though some actions are also POST actions.

**could be nuked without fuss**
  - `display` was used to display a package version but was replaced ages ago
    by the /<package>/<version> URL structure
  - all the user-based stuff like `register_form`, `user`, `user_form`,
    `forgotten_password_form`, `login`, `logout`, `forgotten_password`,
    `password_reset`, `pw_reset` and `pw_reset_change` will most likely be
    replaced by newer mechanisms in warehouse
  - `openid_endpoint`, `openid_decide_post` could also be replaced by something
    else.
  - `home` is the old home page thing and completely unnecessary
  - `index` is overwhelming given the number of projects now.
  - `browse` and `search` are *probably* only referenced by internal links so
    should be safe to nuke
  - `submit_pkg_info` and `display_pkginfo` probably aren't used
  - `submit_form` and `pkg_edit` will be changing anyway
  - `files`, `urls`, `role`, `role_form` are old style and will be changing
  - `list_classifiers` .. this might actually only be used by Richard :)
  - `claim`, `openid`, `openid_return`, `dropid` are legacy openid login
    support and will be changing
  - `clear_auth` "clears" Basic Auth
  - `addkey`, `delkey` will be changing if we even keep supporting ssh submit
  - `verify` probably isn't actually used by anyone
  - `lasthour` is a pubsubhubbub thing - does this even exist any longer?
  - `json` is never used as a :action invocation, only ever /<package>/json
  - `gae_file` I'm pretty sure this is not necessary
  - `rss_regen` manually regens the RSS cached files, not needed
  - `about` No longer needed.
  - `delete_user` No longer needed.
  - `exception` No longer needed.

**will need to retain**
  - `rss` and `packages_rss` will be in a bunch of peoples` RSS readers
  - `doap` is most likely referred to
  - `show_md5` ?

**can be deprecated carefully**
  - `submit`, `upload`, `doc_upload`, `file_upload`,
