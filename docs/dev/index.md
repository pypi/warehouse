# Welcome to Warehouse's documentation!

Warehouse is a [web application](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse) that implements the canonical
[Python package index (repository)](https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-package-index); its production deployment is
[PyPI](https://pypi.org). It replaces an older code base that powered pypi.python.org.

The goal is to improve PyPI by making it:

- be more user-friendly
- have a more modern look
- have more features
- remove legacy APIs
- have more maintainable code with test coverage, docs, etc.
