Integration guide
=================

We provide multiple APIs to help you integrate with PyPI; see
:doc:`index`.

Many tools already integrate with PyPI, uploading packages or
retrieving data; see `the Python Packaging Guide's tool
recommendations
<https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/>`_.


Migrating to the new PyPI
-------------------------

Warehouse has now replaced `the legacy PyPI site that was deployed at
pypi.python.org <https://pypi.python.org/>`_. If your site/service
used to link or upload to pypi.python.org, it may continue to work due
to redirects, but you should use pypi.org instead.

You should also watch `our status page <https://status.python.org/>`__
and subscribe to `the PyPI announcement list (low-traffic)
<https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pypi-announce.python.org/>`_
to find out about future changes.

Here are some tips.

.. note::
  ``{name}`` is the name of the package as represented in the URL;
  for ``https://pypi.org/project/arrow/``, you'd insert ``arrow``
  wherever you see ``{name}``.

* If your client correctly follows redirects, you can replace
  ``pypi.python.org`` in your links with ``pypi.org`` and everything
  should just work. For instance, the project detail page
  ``https://pypi.org/pypi/{name}`` (with or without a trailing slash)
  redirects to ``https://pypi.org/project/{name}/``.

* Shorter URL: ``https://pypi.org/p/{name}/`` will redirect to
  ``https://pypi.org/project/{name}/``.

* All APIs: `access is HTTPS-only
  <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-October/031712.html>`_
  (changed in October 2017). And pypi.org honors an ``Accept-Encoding:
  gzip`` header, whereas pypi.python.org ignored it.

* JSON API: ``https://pypi.org/pypi/{name}/json`` returns the
  expected JSON response directly. See :doc:`json`.

* XML-RPC API: See :ref:`changes-to-legacy-api`. Will be deprecated in
  the future (no specific end date set yet); switch to the RSS or JSON
  APIs. If you depend on an XML-RPC call that our other APIs do not
  support, `tell us <https://pypi.org/help/#feedback>`_.

* Packages/updates RSS feeds: ``https://pypi.org/pypi?%3Aaction=rss``
  redirects to ``https://pypi.org/rss/updates.xml``, and
  ``https://pypi.org/pypi?%3Aaction=packages_rss`` redirects to
  ``https://pypi.org/rss/packages.xml``. See :doc:`feeds` for
  descriptions. `The data differs from the legacy feed data because
  the new feeds are standards-compliant and fix inaccuracies in the
  publication date <https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/3238>`_.

* Documentation upload: Users can no longer use ``doc_upload`` in the
  API to upload documentation ZIP files, separate from packages, to be
  hosted at pythonhosted.org (`discussion
  <https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/509>`_).

* ``User-Agent`` Filtering: Some client user agents were filtered to
  always use ``legacy.pypi.org``, a temporary deployment of the legacy
  PyPI codebase, regardless of brownouts or redirects, in order to
  give them extra time to migrate. On 30 April 2018,
  ``legacy.pypi.org`` was shut down, so all clients use ``pypi.org``
  regardless of their ``User-Agent``.

* Subscribe to `the PyPI announcement list (low-traffic)
  <https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pypi-announce.python.org/>`_.

If you're a PyPI end user or packager looking to migrate to the new
PyPI, see `the official Python Packaging User Guide on migrating to PyPI
<https://packaging.python.org/guides/migrating-to-pypi-org/>`_.


Querying PyPI for Package URLs
------------------------------

When copying a download link from https://pypi.org, you get a URL with a
random hash value in it.

This hash value is calculated from the checksum of the file. The URLs on
PyPI for individual files are static and do not change.

Official guidance
-----------------

Query PyPI’s `JSON
API <https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json/>`__ to
determine where to download files from.

Predictable URLs
----------------

You can use our conveyor service to fetch this file, which exists for
cases where using the API is impractical or impossible. This is for
example the case for Linux package maintainers, as package build scripts
or package metadata expect static URLs in some cases.

URLs can be constructed as follows, with wheel file names following
:pep:`491#file-name-convention`.

.. code:: python

   host = 'https://files.pythonhosted.org'

   def source_url(name, version):
       return f'{host}/packages/source/{name[0]}/{name}/{name}-{version}.tar.gz'

   def wheel_url(name, version, build_tag, python_tag, abi_tag, platform_tag):
       # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0491/#file-name-convention
       wheel_parts = {
           tag: re.sub('[^\w\d.]+', '_', part, re.UNICODE)
           for tag, part in locals().items()
       }
       wheel_parts['optional_build_tag'] = f'-{wheel_parts["build_tag"]}' if build_tag else ''
       filename = '{name}-{version}{optional_build_tag}-{python_tag}-{abi_tag}-{platform_tag}.whl'\
                  .format_map(wheel_parts)
       return f'{host}/packages/{python_tag}/{name[0]}/{name}/{filename}'

Example:
~~~~~~~~

::

   $ curl -I https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-15.2.0.tar.gz
   HTTP/2 302
   location: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b1/72/2d70c5a1de409ceb3a27ff2ec007ecdd5cc52239e7c74990e32af57affe9/virtualenv-15.2.0.tar.gz

As you’ll note, it is just a redirect to the canonical file.
