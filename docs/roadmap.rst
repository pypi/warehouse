Warehouse feature roadmap
=========================

As we develop Warehouse, here are our plans along the way. To talk
about them with us, please `contact us`_.

PyCon 2018 sprints
------------------

At the `sprints`_ in mid-May, we will focus on interoperability with
other tools and on the API redesign.

See `sprint-tagged issues`_ on GitHub.

Post Legacy Shutdown
--------------------
Issues that are unblocked now that legacy is dead (RIP).

See `issues marked with the post-legacy shutdown milestone`_ on GitHub.

Cool but not urgent
-------------------

Wishlist.

See `issues marked with the cool-but-not-urgent milestone`_ on GitHub.

History
