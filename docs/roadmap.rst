History
~~~~~~~

You can see `our past roadmap`_, focusing on replacing legacy PyPI, on
the PSF wiki.

Sprints
-------

Please check the Python Wiki for a list of upcoming `sprints`_.

Sprint planners should consider the following checklist for organising events:

- Prior to the sprint, tag issues that you identify as appropriate for the
  attendees. Ensure you have a mix of short acheivable tickets, and more
  complex issues. Do not tag issues that are still under discussion or require
  specification, unless core team members will be in attendance
- Prior to the sprint, organise with the Working Group to print stickers and/or
  other swag to give to participants
- If not provided by the venue, bring along snacks. Everybody loves snacks.
- If not provided by the venue, bring nametags. If possible, organise the
  facilitators to wear the same colored shirt, lanyard or hat, to be easily
  identified by the group.
- If possible, ask participants to install the codebase *prior* to the event.
  This will save on delays caused by many people downloading docker images at
  once.
- Use a whiteboard or large sheets of paper to direct participants towards the
  codebase, issue tracker and installation documentation. Keep track of merged
  PRs in the same location.
- Ask participants to comment on the issues they want to work on. This avoids a
  situation where two people are unknowingly working towards the same goal.
- Where possible, pair people to work on issues together. This is particularly
  useful for large issues, or for newer developers.
