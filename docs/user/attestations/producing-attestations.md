# Producing attestations

<!--[[ preview('index-attestations') ]]-->

PyPI allows attestations to be attached to individual *release files*
(source and binary distributions within a release) at upload time.

Attestations are currently only supported when uploading with
[Trusted Publishing], and currently only with GitHub-based Trusted Publishers.
Support for other Trusted Publishers is planned. See
[#17001](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/17001) for additional
information.

## The easy way

=== "GitHub Actions"

    If you publish to PyPI with [`pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`][gh-action-pypi-publish]
    (the official PyPA action), attestations are generated and uploaded automatically
    by default, with no additional configuration necessary.

## The manual way

!!! warning

    **STOP! You probably don't need this section; it exists only to provide
    some internal details about how attestation generation and uploading
    work. If you're an ordinary user, it is strongly recommended that
    you use one of the [official workflows described above].**

### Producing attestations

!!! important

    Producing attestations manually does **not** bypass PyPI's current
    restrictions on supported attesting identities (i.e., Trusted Publishers).
    The examples below can be used to sign with a Trusted Publisher *or*
    with other identities, but PyPI will reject non-Trusted Publisher attestations
    at upload time.

#### Using `pypi-attestations`

[`pypi-attestations`][pypi-attestations] is a convenience library and CLI
for generating and interacting with attestation objects. You can use
either interface to produce attestations.

For example, to generate attestations for all distributions in `dist/`:

```bash
python -m pip install pypi-attestations
python -m pypi_attestations sign dist/*
```

If the above is run within a GitHub Actions workflow with `id-token: write`
enabled (i.e., the ordinary context for Trusted Publishing), it will use
the [ambient identity] of the GitHub Actions workflow that invoked it.

If run locally, it will prompt you to perform an OAuth flow for identity
establishment and will use the resulting identity.

See [pypi-attestations' documentation] for usage as a Python library.

#### Converting from Sigstore bundles

Attestations are functionally (but not structurally) compatible with
[Sigstore bundles], meaning that any system that can produce Sigstore
bundles can be adapted to produce attestations.

For example, GitHub's [`actions/attest`][actions-attest] can be used to produce
Sigstore bundles with PyPI's [publish attestation] marker:

```yaml
- name: attest
  uses: actions/attest@v1
  with:
    # Attest to every distribution
    subject-path: dist/*
    predicate-type: 'https://docs.pypi.org/attestations/publish/v1'
    predicate: '{}'
```

Once generated, each Sigstore bundle can be converted into an equivalent
attestation either in the same workflow or offline, using APIs
from `sigstore-python` and `pypi-attestation`:

```python
from pypi_attestations import Attestation
from sigstore.models import Bundle

raw_bundle = "..." # read the bundle's JSON
bundle = Bundle.from_json(raw_bundle)
attestation = Attestation.from_bundle(bundle)

print(attestation.model_dump_json())
```

### Uploading attestations

Attestations are uploaded to PyPI as part of the normal file upload flow.

If you're using [`twine`][twine], you can upload any adjacent attestations
with their associated files by passing `--attestations` to `twine upload`:

```bash
twine upload --attestations dist/*
```

See PyPI's [legacy upload API documentation] for adding attestations to a file
upload at the upload API level.
