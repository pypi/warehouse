These pages document PyPI's implementation of digital attestations ([PEP 740]),
including in-toto attestation predicates specific to PyPI itself.

## Quick background

*Digital attestations* enable package maintainers as well as third parties (such
as the index itself, external auditors, etc.) to *cryptographically sign*
for uploaded packages.

These signatures bind each release distribution (such as an individual sdist or
wheel) to a strong cryptographic digest of its contents, allowing both PyPI
and downstream users to verify that a particular package was attested to by
a particular identity (such as a GitHub Actions workflow).

These attestations can take multiple forms, including [publish attestations]
for publicly verifiable proof that a package was published via a specific
[Trusted Publisher], or more general [SLSA Provenance] attesting to a package's
original source location.

## Supported attestations

PyPI uses the [in-toto Attestation Framework] for the attestations it accepts.

Currently, PyPI allows the following attestation predicates:

* [SLSA Provenance]
* [PyPI Publish]

Each file can be uploaded along its attestations. Currently PyPI supports two
attestations per file: one for each of the allowed predicates. Uploads with more
than two attestations per file, or with attestations with repeated predicates will
be rejected.
