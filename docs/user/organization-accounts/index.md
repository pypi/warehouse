# PyPI Organization Accounts

Organization accounts are coming to PyPI.
In an organization account,
users from an organization or community project
can assemble into teams and collaborate on projects.

## Motivation

Based on feedback from users,
organization accounts were one of the most requested features.
Organization account features are the first step in proving
the provenance of a package. Organization accounts offer
PyPI users a unique brand for their packages.
At an operational level, organization accounts make setting
permissions and publishing packages easy.

Here, we would like to draw a distinction between private
organization accounts and community project accounts.
Private or corporate organizations can access these features
for a monthly subscription fee. These features are available
free of charge for community projects. The features are the same
for both kinds of organizations.
