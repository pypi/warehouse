# FAQs

This list of FAQs pertain to organization accounts in PyPI.

1. **Can anyone create an organization account?**

    Yes, anyone can create an organization. They are available as a paid feature
    for commercial entities and free of cost for community projects.
    To learn how to create an organization account, please see the steps
    to follow [here](https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/actions/org-actions/).

1. **How do I access an organization account?**

    You will have to log in into your PyPI account to
    [access the feature](https://pypi.org/manage/organizations/).

1. **How do you confirm a user is from a specific organization?**

    We ensure the domain name of the email address matches the
    organization URL provided when creating the account. We may follow up
    with more questions to confirm the affiliation.

1. **Why does an admin approve the organization account request?**

    The PyPI admin has to approve the organization account request to ensure
    everyone is billed fairly. We ensure commercial projects pay for the feature
    and community projects can access the account free of charge.

    The PyPI admin also arbitrates any conflict with account names
    when multiple projects have requested the same account name.

1. **How many days does it take for the admin to approve the organization
account request?**

    We are unable to specify a timeline by which the PyPI admin will approve
    the organization account request. As resources are limited and
    there is no dedicated user support for organization accounts, the PyPI admin will review
    all organization account requests periodically.

1. **Who ensures that the organization account request is from a private
organization or a community  project?**

    The PyPI admin will ensure that the private organizations are
    billed and community projects can access the features free of cost.

1. **What happens if an organization account is deleted?**

    Before an account is deleted, the owner will have to transfer all
    projects owned by the organization to another organization or user.
    This ensures that the project history is maintained.
    Once the account is deleted, the team permissions will be deleted.

    Individual project permissions assigned to users will exist
    after the deletion.

1. **Does the PyPI admin have to approve deletion of an organization account?**

    No, the PyPI admin is not involved in the deletion of an organization account.

1. **Is there a limit to the number of users within the organization?**

    No, there is no limit to the number of users within the organization. There is no
    limit to the number of teams in an organization account.

1. **Are command line options available to manage teams/users/projects?**

    Right now, we are unable to support command line options. If this is a feature that you would
    find useful, please submit a feature request
    [here](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues).

1. **How many organizations can a user create?**

    A user can create any number of organization accounts.
    A user can create a new account only when the previous
    request has been approved.

1. **Do organization accounts support namespaces?**

    No, organizations accounts do not support namespaces. While this is a feature that is on our
    to-do list, we do not have any immediate development plans for namespaces.

    No, organization accounts do not support private packages. If this is a feature that you would
    find useful, please submit a feature request
    [here](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues).

1. **If namespaces or private packages are not available,
what do organization accounts offer?**
