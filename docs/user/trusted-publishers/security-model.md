# Security model and considerations

## Security model

GitHub Actions' own security model for OpenID Connect tokens is a little subtle:

* Any workflow defined in a repository can request an OIDC token,
 *with any audience*, **so long as it has the `id-token: write` permission**.

* The claims defined in an OIDC token are *bound to the workflow*, meaning
  that a workflow defined at `foo.yml` in `org/repo` **cannot impersonate**
  a workflow defined at `bar.yml` in `org/repo`. However, if `foo.yml` is
  *renamed* to `bar.yml`, then the *new* `bar.yml` will be indistinguishable
  from the old `bar.yml` **except** for claims that reflect the repository's
  state (e.g. `git` ref, branch, etc.).

* *Generally speaking*, "third party" events **cannot** request an OIDC
  token: even if they can trigger the workflow that requests the token,
  the actual token retrieval step will fail. For example: PRs issued from forks
  of a repository **cannot** access the OIDC tokens in the "upstream"
  repository's workflows.

  * The exception to this is `pull_request_target` events, which are
    **[fundamentally dangerous] by design** and should not be used without
    careful consideration.

## Considerations

While more secure than passwords and long-lived API tokens, OIDC publishing
is not a panacea. In particular:

* Short-lived API tokens are still sensitive material, and should not be
  disclosed (ideally not at all, but certainly not before they expire).

* OIDC tokens themselves are sensitive material, and should not be disclosed.
  OIDC tokens are also short-lived, but an attacker who successfully intercepts
  one can mint API tokens against it for as long as it lives.

* Configuring a trusted publisher means establishing trust in a particular piece
  of external state; that state **must not** be controllable by untrusted
  parties. In particular, for trusted publishing with GitHub Actions, you
  **must**:

   * Trust the correct username and repository: if you trust a repository
     other than one you control and trust, that repository can upload to your
     PyPI project.

   * Trust the correct workflow: you shouldn't trust every workflow
     to upload to PyPI; instead, you should isolate responsibility to the
     smallest (and least-privileged) possible separate workflow. We recommend
     naming this workflow `release.yml`.

   * Take care when merging third-party changes to your code: if you trust
     `release.yml`, then you must make sure that third-party changes to that
     workflow (or code that runs within that workflow) are not malicious.

   * Take care when adding repository contributors, members, and administrators:
     by default, anybody who can unconditionally commit to your repository can
     also modify your publishing workflow to make it trigger on events you
     may not intend (e.g., a manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger).

     This particular risk can be mitigated by using a dedicated environment
     with manual approvers, as described below.

* Trusted publishers are registered to projects, not to users. This means that
  removing a user from a PyPI project does **not** remove any trusted publishers
  that they might have registered, and that you should include a review
  of any/all trusted publishers as part of "offboarding" a project maintainer.

PyPI has protections in place to make some attacks against OIDC more difficult
(like [account resurrection attacks]). However, like all forms of authentication,
the end user is **fundamentally responsible** for applying it correctly.

In addition to the requirements above, you can do the following to
"ratchet down" the scope of your trusted publishing workflows:

* **Use per-job permissions**: The `permissions` key can be defined on the
  workflow level or the job level; the job level is **always more secure**
  because it limits the number of jobs that receive elevated `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  credentials.

* **[Use a dedicated environment]**: GitHub Actions supports "environments,"
  which can be used to isolate secrets to specific workflows. OIDC publishing
  doesn't use any pre-configured secrets, but a dedicated `publish` or `deploy`
  environment is a general best practice.

  Dedicated environments allow for additional protections like
  [required reviewers], which can be used to require manual approval for a
  workflow using the environment.

  For example, here is how `pypa/pip-audit`'s `release` environment
  restricts reviews to members of the maintenance and admin teams:

* **[Use tag protection rules]**: if you use a tag-based publishing workflow
  (e.g. triggering on tags pushed), then you can limit tag creation and
  modification to maintainers and higher (or custom roles) for any tags
  that match your release pattern. For example, `v*` will prevent
  non-maintainers from creating or modifying tags that match version
  strings like `v1.2.3`.

* **Limit the scope of your publishing job**: your publishing job should
  (ideally) have only two steps:

   1. Retrieve the publishable distribution files from **a separate
     build job**;

   2. Publish the distributions using `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`.

  By using a separate build job, you keep the number of steps that can
  access the OIDC token to a bare minimum. This prevents both accidental
  and malicious disclosure.
