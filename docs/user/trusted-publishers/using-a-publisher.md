# Publishing with a Trusted Publisher

## The easy way

Once you have a publisher configured, you can use the
PyPA's [`pypi-publish`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pypi-publish)
action to publish your packages.

This looks *almost* exactly the same as normal, except that you don't
need any explicit usernames, passwords, or API tokens: GitHub's OIDC identity provider
will take care of everything for you:

```yaml
jobs:
  pypi-publish:
    name: upload release to PyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Specifying a GitHub environment is optional, but strongly encouraged
    environment: release
    permissions:
      # IMPORTANT: this permission is mandatory for trusted publishing
      id-token: write
    steps:
      # retrieve your distributions here

      - name: Publish package distributions to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
```

If you're moving away from a password or API token-based authentication
flow, your diff might look like this:

```diff
 jobs:
   pypi-publish:
     name: upload release to PyPI
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+    # Specifying a GitHub environment is optional, but strongly encouraged
+    environment: release
+    permissions:
+      # IMPORTANT: this permission is mandatory for trusted publishing
+      id-token: write
     steps:
       # retrieve your distributions here

       - name: Publish package distributions to PyPI
         uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
-        with:
-          username: __token__
-          password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

Note the `id-token: write` permission: you **must** provide this permission
at either the job level (**strongly recommended**) or workflow level
(**discouraged**). Without it, the publishing action
won't have sufficient permissions to identify itself to PyPI.

!!! note

    Using the permission at the job level is **strongly** encouraged, as
    it reduces unnecessary credential exposure.

### Publishing to indices other than PyPI
The PyPA's [`pypi-publish`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pypi-publish)
action also supports trusted publishing with other (non-PyPI) indices, provided
they have trusted publishing enabled (and you've configured your trusted
publisher on them). For example, here's how you can use trusted publishing on
[TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org):

```yaml
- name: Publish package distributions to TestPyPI
  uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
  with:
    repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

## The manual way

!!! warning

    **STOP! You probably don't need this section; it exists only to provide some
    internal details about how GitHub Actions and PyPI coordinate using OIDC.
    If you're an ordinary user, it is strongly recommended that you use the PyPA's
    [`pypi-publish`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pypi-publish)
    action instead.**

The process for using an OIDC publisher is:

1. Retrieve an *OIDC token* from the OIDC *identity provider*;
2. Submit that token to PyPI, which will return a short-lived API key;
3. Use that API key as you normally would (e.g. with `twine`)

GitHub is currently the only OIDC identity provider supported, so we'll use it
for examples below.

All code below assumes that it's being run in a GitHub Actions
workflow runner with `id-token: write` permissions. That permission is
**critical**; without it, GitHub Actions will refuse to give you an OIDC token.

First, let's grab the OIDC token from GitHub Actions:

```bash
resp=$(curl -H "Authorization: bearer $ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN" \
    "$ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL&audience=pypi")
```

**NOTE**: `audience=pypi` is only correct for PyPI. For TestPyPI, the correct
audience is `testpypi`. More generally, you can access any instance's expected
OIDC audience via the `{index}/_/oidc/audience` endpoint:

```console
$ curl https://pypi.org/_/oidc/audience
{"audience":"pypi"}
```

The response to this will be a JSON blob, which contains the OIDC token.
We can pull it out using `jq`:

```bash
oidc_token=$(jq '.value' <<< "${resp}")
```

Finally, we can submit that token to PyPI and get a short-lived API token
back:

```bash
resp=$(curl -X POST https://pypi.org/_/oidc/github/mint-token -d "{\"token\": \"${oidc_token}\"}")
api_token=$(jq '.token' <<< "${resp}")

# tell GitHub Actions to mask the token in any console logs,
# to avoid leaking it
echo "::add-mask::${api_token}"
```

This API token can be fed into `twine` or any other uploading client:

```bash
TWINE_USERNAME=__token__ TWINE_PASSWORD="${api_token}" twine upload dist/*
```

This can all be tied together into a single GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
on:
  release:
    types:
      - published

name: release

jobs:
  pypi:
    name: upload release to PyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.x"

      - name: deps
        run: python -m pip install -U build

      - name: build
        run: python -m build

      - name: mint API token
        id: mint-token
        run: |
          # retrieve the ambient OIDC token
          resp=$(curl -H "Authorization: bearer $ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN" \
            "$ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL&audience=pypi")
          oidc_token=$(jq '.value' <<< "${resp}")

          # exchange the OIDC token for an API token
          resp=$(curl -X POST https://pypi.org/_/oidc/github/mint-token -d "{\"token\": \"${oidc_token}\"}")
          api_token=$(jq '.token' <<< "${resp}")

          # mask the newly minted API token, so that we don't accidentally leak it
          echo "::add-mask::${api_token}"

          # see the next step in the workflow for an example of using this step output
          echo "api-token=${api_token}" >> "${GITHUB_OUTPUT}"

      - name: publish
        # gh-action-pypi-publish uses TWINE_PASSWORD automatically
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          password: ${{ steps.mint-token.outputs.api-token }}
```
