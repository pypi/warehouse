# Adding a trusted publisher to an existing PyPI project

Adding a trusted publisher to a PyPI project only requires a single setup step.

On the ["Your projects" page](https://pypi.org/manage/projects/), click "Manage" on any project you'd like to
configure:

Then, click on "Publishing" in the project's sidebar:

![](/assets/trusted-publishing/project-publishing-link.png)

That link will take you to the publisher configuration page for the project,
which will allow you to configure trusted publishers for the different
platforms supported by PyPI (such as GitHub Actions).

To enable a publisher, you need to tell PyPI how to trust it. Each trusted
publisher has its own configuration requirements; click the tabs below to see
each.

=== "GitHub Actions"

    For GitHub Actions, you **must** provide the repository owner's name, the
    repository's name, and the filename of the GitHub Actions workflow that's
    authorized to upload to PyPI. In addition, you may **optionally**
    provide the name of a [GitHub Actions environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).

    For example, if you have a project at `https://github.com/octo-org/sampleproject`
    that uses a publishing workflow defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
    and a custom environment named `release`, then you'd do the following:

    ![](/assets/trusted-publishing/github/project-publishing-form.png)

    !!! note

        Configuring an environment is optional, but **strongly** recommended:
        with a GitHub environment, you can apply additional restrictions to
        your trusted workflow, such as requiring manual approval on each run
        by a trusted subset of repository maintainers.

    Once you click "Add", your publisher will be registered and will appear
    at the top of the page:

    ![](/assets/trusted-publishing/github/project-publisher-registered.png)

    From this point onwards, the `release.yml` workflow on `octo-org/sampleproject` will
    be able to generate short-lived API tokens from PyPI for the project you've registered
    it against.

=== "Google Cloud"

    For Google Cloud, you **must** provide the email address of the account or
    service account used to publish. [You can learn more about Google Cloud
    service accounts
    here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview).

    For example, if you have created a service account named
    "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME" in the project "PROJECT_NAME" which is in use by
    the environment where you would like to publish to PyPI from, your service
    account email would take the form
    `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com`, and you would do
    the following:

    ![](/assets/trusted-publishing/google/project-publishing-form.png)

    !!! warning

        Google Cloud also provides [default service
        accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#default)
        for various products:

          *  Compute Engine: `PROJECT_ID-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`
          *  App Engine: `PROJECT_NAME@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`

        However it is **not** recommended that these be used for publishing, as
        they are provided by default to every service when they are created.

    !!! note

        Configuring the subject is optional. The subject is the numeric ID that
        represents the principal making the request. While not required, providing the
        subject further restricts the identity which is used for publishing, ensuring
        that only a specific instance of a service account can publish, not any service
        account with the configured email. See
        <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/token-types#id-contents>
        for more details

    Once you click "Add", your publisher will be registered and will appear
    at the top of the page:

    ![](/assets/trusted-publishing/google/project-publisher-registered.png)

=== "ActiveState"

    For ActiveState, you need to provide the name of the ActiveState project,
    the ActiveState organization that project belongs to, and the ActiveState user performing
    the publish action. Learn more about getting set up on the ActiveState Platform [here](https://docs.activestate.com/platform/start/PYPI).

    Once you click "Add", your publisher will be registered and will appear at the top of the page:
    ![](/assets/trusted-publishing/activestate/project-publisher-registered.png)

=== "GitLab CI/CD"

    For GitLab CI/CD, you **must** provide the repository's namespace, the
    repository's name, and the filepath of the GitLab CI/CD workflow that's
    authorized to upload to PyPI. In addition, you may **optionally**
    provide the name of a
    [GitLab CI/CD environment](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/).

    For example, if you have a project at `https://gitlab.com/namespace/sampleproject`
    that uses a publishing workflow defined in `release.yml` and a custom
    environment named `release`, then you'd do the following:

    ![](/assets/trusted-publishing/gitlab/project-publishing-form.png)

    !!! note

        Configuring an environment is optional, but **strongly** recommended:
        with a GitLab environment, you can apply additional restrictions to
        your trusted workflow, such as requiring manual approval on each run
        by a trusted subset of repository maintainers.

    Once you click "Add", your publisher will be registered and will appear
    at the top of the page:

    ![](/assets/trusted-publishing/gitlab/project-publisher-registered.png)

    From this point onwards, the `release.yml` workflow on `namespace/sampleproject`
    will be able to generate short-lived API tokens from PyPI for the project you've
    registered it against.

A publisher can be registered against multiple PyPI projects (e.g. for a
multi-project repository), and a single PyPI project can have multiple
publishers (e.g. for multiple workflows on different architectures, operating
systems).
