# Introduction

<!--[[ preview('user-api-docs') ]]-->

PyPI has several API endpoints and public datasets, each of which is referenced
in the table of contents for this hierarchy.

## API policies

Please be aware of these PyPI API policies.

### Caching

All API requests are cached. Requests to the JSON, RSS or Index APIs are
cached by our CDN provider. You can determine if you've hit the cache based on
the `X-Cache` and `X-Cache-Hits` headers in the response.

Requests to the JSON, RSS and Index APIs also provide an `ETag` header. If
you're making a lot of repeated requests, ensure your API consumer will respect
this header to determine whether to actually repeat a request or not.

The XML-RPC API does not have the ability to indicate cached responses.

### Rate limiting

Due to the heavy caching and CDN use, there is currently no rate limiting of
PyPI APIs at the edge. The XML-RPC API may be rate limited if usage is causing
degradation of service.

In addition, PyPI reserves the right to temporarily or permanently prohibit a
consumer based on irresponsible activity.

If you plan to make a lot of requests to a PyPI API, adhere to these
suggestions:

* Set your consumer's `User-Agent` header to uniquely identify your requests.
  Adding your contact information to this value would be helpful as well.
* Try not to make a lot of requests (thousands) in a short amount of time
  (minutes). Generally PyPI can handle it, but it's preferred to make requests
  in serial over a longer amount of time if possible.
* If your consumer is actually an organization or service that will be
  downloading a lot of packages from PyPI, consider
  [using your own index mirror or cache].

### API Preference

For periodically checking for new packages or updates to existing packages,
use our [RSS feeds].

No new integrations should use the XML-RPC APIs as they are planned for
deprecation. Existing consumers should migrate to JSON/RSS/[Index APIs].

## Integration guide

Many tools already integrate with PyPI, uploading packages or
retrieving data; see [the Python Packaging Guide's tool recommendations].

### Querying PyPI for Package URLs

When copying a download link from <https://pypi.org>, you get a URL with a
random hash value in it.

This hash value is calculated from the checksum of the file. The URLs on
PyPI for individual files are static and do not change.

### Official guidance

Query PyPI's [Index API] or [JSON API] to determine where to download files
from.

### Predictable URLs

You can use our conveyor service to fetch this file, which exists for
cases where using the API is impractical or impossible. This is for
example the case for Linux package maintainers, as package build scripts
or package metadata expect static URLs in some cases.

URLs can be constructed as follows, with wheel file names following
[PEP 491's file name convention].

```python
host = 'https://files.pythonhosted.org'

def source_url(name, version):
    return f'{host}/packages/source/{name[0]}/{name}/{name}-{version}.tar.gz'

def wheel_url(name, version, build_tag, python_tag, abi_tag, platform_tag):
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0491/#file-name-convention
    wheel_parts = {
        tag: re.sub(r'[^\w\d.]+', '_', part, re.UNICODE)
        for tag, part in locals().items()
    }
    wheel_parts['optional_build_tag'] = f'-{wheel_parts["build_tag"]}' if build_tag else ''
    filename = '{name}-{version}{optional_build_tag}-{python_tag}-{abi_tag}-{platform_tag}.whl'\
               .format_map(wheel_parts)
    return f'{host}/packages/{python_tag}/{name[0]}/{name}/{filename}'
```

Example predicable URL use:

```bash
$ curl -I https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-15.2.0.tar.gz
HTTP/2 302
location: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b1/72/2d70c5a1de409ceb3a27ff2ec007ecdd5cc52239e7c74990e32af57affe9/virtualenv-15.2.0.tar.gz
```

As youâ€™ll note, it is just a redirect to the canonical file.
