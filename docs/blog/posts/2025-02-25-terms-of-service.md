We're introducing a new
[Terms of Service](https://policies.python.org/pypi.org/Terms-of-Service/)
to formalize our relationship to users
and enable us to move forward with providing new features and services,
specifically
[Organization Accounts](https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/).

<!-- more -->

PyPI has had some form of [Terms of Use](https://policies.python.org/pypi.org/Terms-of-Use/)
document for users since it
[began accepting uploads in 2005](https://github.com/pypi/legacy/commit/b139c00cfc5794159afb1fc185d77dbc5fc1a2a4#diff-a67499b048e6bb6ef08d44c7a3c541199615b68e3bd153eb0ccedc492e3dec9dR7-R13)
and has only been updated twice[^1] since.
These terms have primarily served to protect PyPI
and the Python Software Foundation (PSF) who operates it.

Over time we have introduced additional policies to protect our users and community
such as our
[Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/)
[Privacy Notice](https://policies.python.org/pypi.org/Privacy-Notice/)
and
[Acceptable Use Policy](https://policies.python.org/pypi.org/Acceptable-Use-Policy/).

Our new
[Terms of Service](https://policies.python.org/pypi.org/Terms-of-Service/)
formalizes our relationship to PyPI users,
makes protections for the PSF and PyPI users more explicit,
and establishes terms we need to provide
[Organization Accounts](https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/)
to paid
[Corporate Organizations](https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/pricing-and-payments/#corporate-organizations).

We have worked with our legal team to retain compatibility with the superseded
[Terms of Use](https://policies.python.org/pypi.org/Terms-of-Use/)
while adding as permissive a set of new terms as possible to ensure that PyPI users 
and the PSF are protected.

You will notice a banner on login reminding you of these updated terms,
as well as an email notification to your primary email address if it has been verified.
These terms will take effect for existing users March 27, 2025 and
your continued use of PyPI after that date constitutes agreement to these new terms.
