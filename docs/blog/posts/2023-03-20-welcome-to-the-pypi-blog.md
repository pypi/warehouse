Today, we're excited to announce the launch of [blog.pypi.org](https://blog.pypi.org), the official blog of the Python Package Index.

We'll use this space to communicate with PyPI users, provide announcements about new features and updates, as well as share information and context around PyPI and related efforts of the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).

Stay tuned for more, we're very glad you're here! ðŸ‘‹
