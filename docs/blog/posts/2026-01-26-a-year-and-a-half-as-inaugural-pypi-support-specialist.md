Hello there! I am Maria, the inaugural PyPI Support Specialist. 
I go by "thespibrain" on GitHub. 
I wanted to provide a dispatch of how this past year (and a half!) 
has been regarding my role and PyPI. PyPI has now reached over a million users and has over 700,000 projects. 
It is, without a doubt, a critical part of the Python ecosystem. 
As the inaugural PyPI Support Specialist, there were numerous challenges that needed to be tackled regarding PyPI support, 
such as the ever growing backlog of account recovery and PEP 541 issues. 

<!-- more -->

Prior to stepping into this role, the account recovery backlog was four months behind. 
The PEP 541 backlog was a year and four months behind. 
There was also a lack of documentation around PyPI Support procedures. 
I started my role at PSF in July 2024. I am happy to report some highlights of my tenure so far:

* Account Recovery backlog is now current with average triage time of 1.5 days[^1]
* PEP 541 backlog is current as of December 2025, with an average first triage/issue response time of 1 week[^1]
* Between July 2024 and December 2024, **725** of account recovery issues were resolved
* Between Jan 2025 and December 2025, **2221** account recovery issues were resolved
* Between Jan 2025 and December 2025, over **~500** PEP 541 issues were resolved

Since there was no documentation prior to this role, support processes and procedures have been internally documented with an end user friendly version coming out soon! 

With account recovery and PEP 541 backlog under control, this also provided an opportunity to focus on getting PyPI Orgs back up again after its introduction in 2023. 
As of today, over 8000 applications have been approved with both community and company organizations combined. 

In addition to the above, I have also created several feature requests for the Warehouse side of things to facilitate better workflow and tooling, particularly with PyPI Org application processing as well as feature suggestions to better process PEP 541 issues that are related to ultranormalized names. 

A lot has been accomplished in the first year (and a half!), but of course, there is always more work to be done to ensure that PyPI is running smoothly. 
Here’s to another year (and a half!) of more exciting things to come!
