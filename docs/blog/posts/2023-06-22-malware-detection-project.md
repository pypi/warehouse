We are pleased to announce that the PSF has received funding 
from the [Center for Security and Emerging Technology](https://cset.georgetown.edu/) 
(CSET) to develop and improve the infrastructure for 
malware reporting and response on PyPI. This project will be executed over the coming year.

Currently, malware reports are submitted to PyPI admins by email before 
being manually triaged and responded to. There is an opportunity for 
improvement in streamlining the report submission process and the tools 
used to triage and respond to them. The current process cannot scale 
easily or handle duplication of reports. It is not easy to measure 
time to remediation and is currently impossible to implement 
automated takedown of threats.

This project has the following aims:

- Develop an API that allows malware reporting
- Extend PyPI admin tools to view, collate and handle security reports
- Collect metadata as required and identify trusted reporters
- Define metrics that allow us to define good reporting practices 
and time to handle a security issue
- Define the criteria for automated consensus based takedown and 
soft-deletes of packages
- Highlight trusted reporters and report quality

As PyPI is an integral part of the Python ecosystem, this project 
is crucial in ensuring the security of over 450,000 packages that 
are trusted by millions of Python developers. Over the next few 
weeks, we will be working with security reporters to identify 
key elements that should be supported by the API and useful 
metrics that would add value to PyPI security reporting. If 
you or your colleagues are currently performing malware 
analysis of PyPI uploads, we would love to hear from you 
at [https://forms.gle/ixRoNJEPVNekFN7H7](https://forms.gle/ixRoNJEPVNekFN7H7).
