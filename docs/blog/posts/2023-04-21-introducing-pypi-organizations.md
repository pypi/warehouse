Today, we take the first step in our plan to increase financial support and
long-term sustainability of the Python Packaging Index (PyPI), while
simultaneously giving our users one of our most requested features:
organization accounts.

### Introducing Organizations

Organizations on PyPI are self-managed teams, with their own exclusive branded
web addresses. Our goal is to make PyPI easier to use for large community
projects, organizations or companies who manage multiple sub-teams and multiple
packages. We’re making organizations available to community projects for free,
forever, and to corporate projects for a small fee. Priority support will also
be available to all paid subscribers, and all revenue will go right back into
PyPI to continue building better support and infrastructure for all our users.

### Increasing sustainability and support

In 2022 PyPI served 199,529,846,822 downloads for the 428,120 projects hosted
there. This means that in 2022, PyPI saw a 57% growth in download counts and
bandwidth alike. Having more people using and contributing to Python every year
is an fantastic problem to have, but it is one we must increase organizational
capacity to accommodate. Increased revenue for PyPI allows it to become a
staffed platform, one that can respond to support requests and attend to issues
in a timeframe that is significantly faster than what our excellent (but thinly
spread) largely volunteer team could reasonably handle.

### Organizations are opt-in

We also want to be very clear—these new features are completely optional. If
features for larger projects don't sound like something that would be useful to
you as a PyPI maintainer, then there is no obligation to create a team and
absolutely nothing about your PyPI experience will change for you.

### We want your feedback

We look forward to discussing what other features PyPI users would like to see
tackled next. We know there are lots of ideas out there around safety,
security and usability and we’re looking forward to hearing about anything that
you think would benefit the community. And in the spirit of open source, [we
welcome your feedback](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues) on what's on
offer so far.

### Get started today

Both community projects (non-profits, NGO’s, hobbyists, etc) and corporate
teams can [sign up to request their organization name starting
today](https://pypi.org/manage/organizations/). Corporate teams will be able to
finalize their signup with billing details in May.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to our [sponsors](https://pypi.org/sponsors/), whose initial support
made the development of this feature possible. Thanks as well to our beta
testers, including the following new PyPI organizations:

* Python Cryptographic Authority (<https://pypi.org/org/pyca/>)
* The Pallets Project (<https://pypi.org/org/pallets/>)
