Today, we're excited to launch [blog.pypi.org](https://blog.pypi.org),
the official blog of the Python Package Index.

One of the most common refrains I hear from Python community members,
irrespective of if they have been around for days or years,
is _"I didn't realize that PyPI..."_. Followed by something along the lines of:

<!-- more -->

- Could **do** that
- Is operated with **so** few resources[^1]
- Only had **3** administrators[^2]
- Needs **more** help

That is certainly in part due to the fact that the people[^3] who
make PyPI "happen" are *humble*, and do so with the limited time they
have to commit to the project among their other responsibilities.
But its also because writing is hard. Harder still when there is
not a convenient tool at hand.
We're hoping that a modern and extensible stack[^4] for this blog
will make writing about and sharing our work more frictionless.

The PyPI team will use this space to communicate with PyPI users,
provide announcements about new features and updates,
interesting technology, as well as share information and
context around PyPI and related efforts of the
[Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).

Stay tuned for more, we're very glad you're here! 💜

[Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/fast-forward) is the single most
important factor allowing us to get by with comparatively few
resources for our backends.
