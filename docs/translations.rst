Translations
============

We use `Weblate <https://weblate.org/>`_ to manage PyPI translations. Visit the
`Warehouse project on Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/pypa/warehouse/>`_
to contribute.

If you are experiencing issues as a translator, please let us know by opening a
`translation issue on the Warehouse issue tracker <https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/new?template=translation-issue.md>`_.
