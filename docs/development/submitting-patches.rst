Submitting patches
==================

* Always make a new branch for your work.
* Patches should be small to facilitate easier review. `Studies have shown`_
  that review quality falls off as patch size grows. Sometimes this will result
  in many small PRs to land a single large feature.
* You must have legal permission to distribute any code you contribute to
  Warehouse, and it must be available under the Apache Software License Version
  2.0.

If you believe you've identified a security issue in Warehouse, please
follow the directions on the :doc:`security page </security>`.

Code
----

When in doubt, refer to :pep:`8` for Python code. You can check if your code
meets our automated requirements by running ``make lint`` against it.

`Write comments as complete sentences.`_

Class names which contains acronyms or initialisms should always be
capitalized. A class should be named ``HTTPClient``, not ``HttpClient``.

Every code file must start with the boilerplate licensing notice:

.. code-block:: python

You can view :doc:`patterns` to see more patterns that should be used within
Warehouse.


Tests
-----

All code changes must be accompanied by unit tests with 100% code coverage (as
measured by `coverage.py`_).


Documentation
-------------

Important information should be documented with prose in the ``docs`` section.
To ensure it builds and passes `doc8`_ style checks you can run
``make docs`` and ``make lint`` respectively.
