Frontend
========

The Warehouse frontend is (as you might suspect) written in JavaScript with the
CSS handled by SCSS. It uses ``gulp`` to process these files and prepare them for
serving.

All of the static files are located in ``warehouse/static/`` and external
libraries are found in ``package.json``.


Building
--------

Static files should be automatically built when ``make serve`` is running;
however, you can trigger a manual build of them by installing all of the
dependencies using ``npm install`` and then running ``gulp dist``.


Deploying
---------

When deploying changes to the frontend, to see the changes immediately it is
necessary to purge the cache.

Individual pages can be purged from the command line by issuing a ``XPURGE``
request, e.g.::

    curl -XPURGE https://pypi.org/the/page/to/purge

All HTML pages can be dropped from the cache by purging the ``all-html``
surrogate key via our CDN provider.

The entire cache can be purged by issuing a "Purge All" via our CDN provider.

Purging the cache is not usually necessary when making frontend changes, unless
it would be unacceptable for the site to simultaneously have an "old" version
of some pages, but the "new" version of others.

HTML Code Style
---------------

Warehouse follows the `Google HTML style guide
<https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html>`_, which is
enforced via linting with `HTML Linter
<https://github.com/deezer/html-linter>`_.

Exceptions to these rules include:

- Protocols can be included in links - we prefer to include ``https`` protocols
- All HTML tags should be closed

We also allow both dashes and underscores in our class names, as we
follow the `Nicholas Gallagher variation
<http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/>`_
of the `BEM naming methodology <https://en.bem.info/>`_.

More information on how BEM works can be found in `this article from
CSS Wizardry
<https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/>`_.

When using ``target="_blank_"`` for a hyperlink (usually to an external site),
we should always set ``rel="noopener"``.


SCSS Style and Structure
------------------------

Warehouse follows the `Airbnb CSS/Sass style guide <https://github.com/airbnb/css>`_,
with the exception that JS hooks should be prefixed with ``-js`` rather
than ``js``.

Our SCSS codebase is structured according to the `ITCSS system
<https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-scale-web-projects-new-css-architecture-itcss-41514731>`_.
The principle of this system is to break SCSS code into layers and
import them into a main stylesheet in an order moving from generic to
specific. This tightly controls the cascade of styles.

The majority of the SCSS styles are found within the 'blocks' layer,
with each BEM block in its own file. All blocks are documented at the top of
the file to provide guidelines for use and modification.

One of these blocks provides code syntax highlighting, which can be tested with
reference project provided at `<http://localhost/project/pypi-code-highlighting-demo/>`_
when using development database. Source reStructuredText file is available
`here <https://github.com/evemorgen/pypi-code-highlighting-demo>`_.
