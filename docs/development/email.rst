Working with E-mails

Writing e-mails
---------------

Find a meaningful name for your email, we'll use
``something-awesome-happened``.

Create those 3 new templates in a folder named like your email:

- ``warehouse/templates/email/something-awesome-happened/body.txt``
- ``warehouse/templates/email/something-awesome-happened/subject.txt``
- ``warehouse/templates/email/something-awesome-happened/subject.html``

Write these templates (as ``jinja2`` templates), take note of the context
variables you need.

Add a function in ``warehouse/emails/__init__.py`` that will take ``request``
and ``user`` as well as any number of parameters, and will return the context
for rendering your email::

    @_email("something-awesome-happened")
    def send_something_awesome_happened_email(
        request, user, *, arbitrary, arguments
    ):
        return {
            "arbitrary": arbitrary,
            "arguments": arguments,
        }

From your code, call that function.

What it does
------------

Calling a function with the ``_email`` decorator does the following:

- The email is sent from an asynchronous task, to avoid delaying the HTTP
  response
- A security log is added to the user's account
- The email is sent using Amazon SES (on production environment)

Testing e-mails
---------------

When an email is sent in the development environment, it's printed in the
console, and sent to the ``maildev`` service using SMTP. ``maildev`` is a
service defined in ``docker-compose.yml`` that receives emails, stores them and
lets you read them from a web interface at `<http://localhost:1080>`_.
