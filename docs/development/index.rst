Development
===========

Warehouse, as an open-source project, welcomes contributions of all forms. The
sections below will help you get started with development, testing, and
documentation.

Please contribute issues, submit bug reports, and file feature requests on our
issue tracker on `GitHub`_. If submitting a bug report for the first time,
check out `"What to put in your bug report"`_ for guidance.

.. important:: We take security very seriously. As such, security issues should
               be emailed to the maintainers instead of being submitted on the
               GitHub issue tracker. Read the :ref:`security` documentation for
               details.

You can also join ``#pypa`` (general packaging discussion and user support) and
``#pypa-dev`` (discussion about development of packaging tools) `on Freenode`_,
or the `pypa-dev mailing list`_, to ask questions or get involved.
