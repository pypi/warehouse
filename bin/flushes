Use of flush() is _often_ unnecessary and should be annotated with a comment:

    my_object = MyObject(
        name=name,
        display_name=display_name,
    )
    self.db.add(my_object)
    self.db.flush()  # flush the db now so my_object.id is available
    method_that_depends_on_id(my_object)

is a common pattern when auto-generated ids are needed.

Parts of the warehouse codebase (namely our cache_key/purge_key machinery)
react to flushes and may have unintended side-effects as a result of calls to
flush().
