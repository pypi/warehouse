    # a maximum of 50,000 URLs. We need to split our URLs up into multiple
    # files so we need to stick all of our URLs into buckets, in addition we
    # want our buckets to remain stable so that an URL won't change what bucket
    # it is in just because another URL is added or removed. Finally we also
    # want to minimize the number of buckets we have to reduce the number of
    # HTTP requests on top of the fact that there is also a 50,000 limit of
    # buckets in these scheme before we need to nest buckets. In order to
    # satisfy these requirements we will take the URL and use a SHA512 hash to
    # pseudo-randomly distribute our URLs amongst many buckets, but we'll only
    # take the first letter of the hash to serve as our bucket, and if at some
    # point in the future we need more buckets we can take the first two
    # characters of the hash instead of just the first. Since the hash is a
    # property of the URL what bucket an URL goes into won't be influenced by
    # what other URLs exist in the system.
