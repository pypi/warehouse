# On the surface this might seem wrong, because retrying a request whose data violates
# the constraints of the database doesn't seem like a useful endeavor. However what
# happens if you have two requests that are trying to insert a row, and that row
# contains a unique, user provided value, you can get into a race condition where both
# requests check the database, see nothing with that value exists, then both attempt to
# insert it. One of the requests will succeed, the other will fail with an
# IntegrityError. Retrying the request that failed will then have it see the object
# created by the other request, and will have it do the appropriate action in that case.
#
# The most common way to run into this, is when submitting a form in the browser, if the
# user clicks twice in rapid succession, the browser will send two almost identical
# requests at basically the same time.
#
# One possible issue that this raises, is that it will slow down "legitimate"
# IntegrityError because they'll have to fail multiple times before they ultimately
# fail. We consider this an acceptable trade off, because deterministic IntegrityError
# should be caught with proper validation prior to submitting records to the database
# anyways.
