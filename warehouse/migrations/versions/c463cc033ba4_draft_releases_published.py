# Note: It is VERY important to ensure that a migration does not lock for a
#       long period of time and to ensure that each individual migration does
#       not break compatibility with the *previous* version of the code base.
#       This is because the migrations will be ran automatically as part of the
#       deployment process, but while the previous version of the code is still
#       up and running. Thus backwards incompatible changes must be broken up
#       over multiple migrations inside of multiple pull requests in order to
#       phase them in over multiple deploys.
