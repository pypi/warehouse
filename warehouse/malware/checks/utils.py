    Retrieves the content of the given path from the given archive stream

    Handling of the given path is a little special: since the dist format(s)
    don't enforce any naming convention for the base archive directory,
    the path is interpreted as {base}/{file_path}. Thus, a call like this:

        extract_file_content(stream, "setup.py")

    will extract and return the contents of {base}/setup.py where {base}
    is frequently (but not guaranteed to be) something like $name-$version.

    Returns None on any sort of failure.
