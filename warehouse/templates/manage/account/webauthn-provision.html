  <h2>How two factor authentication with WebAuthn works</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>When you sign into PyPI, you will be asked to provide your username and password, as usual</li>
    <li>You will then see a screen asking for a secondary login method</li>
    <li>Insert and activate your key (provisioned below), to access your PyPI account</li>
  </ol>

    <p>WebAuthn cannot be used without JavaScript.</p>
