      To set the '{{ project.name }}' description, author, links,
      classifiers, and other details for your next release, use
      the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#setup-args" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><tt>setup()</tt>
      arguments in your <tt>setup.py</tt> file</a>. Updating these
      fields will not change the metadata for past
      releases. Additionally, you <strong>must</strong> use
      <a href="https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twine</a>
      to upload your files in order to get full support for these fields. See
      <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Python Packaging User Guide</a> for more help.
