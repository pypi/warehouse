    <p>You may sign your uploads with GPG using the "--sign" argument to
      "python setup.py upload".</p>

    <p>Additionally you may avoid using the default HTTP authentication used on
      the site and instead <a href="https://github.com/pypa/twine">upload using
        twine</a>.</p>

    <p>The SHA-256 hash provided with files on PyPI exists <b>only</b> to
      provide some download corruption protection. It is <b>not</b> intended to
      provide any sort of security regarding tampering. Please use GPG signing
      for that.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/">PEP 458</a> and
      <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0480/">PEP 480</a> propose
      using <a href="http://theupdateframework.com/">The Update Framework
        (TUF)</a> to secure Warehouse against man-in-the-middle attacks and a
        compromise of Warehouse itself respectively.</p>
