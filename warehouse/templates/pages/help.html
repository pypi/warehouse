      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <h3 id="packages" class="common-question">What's a package, project, or release?</h3>

      <p>We use a number of terms to describe software available on PyPI, like <em>project</em>, <em>release</em>, <em>file</em>, and <em>package</em>. Sometimes those terms are confusing because they're used to describe different things in other contexts. Here's how we use them on PyPI:</p>

      <p>A <em>project</em> on PyPI is the name of a collection of releases and files, and information about them. Projects on PyPI are made and shared by other members of the Python community so that you can use them.</p>

      <p>A <em>release</em> on PyPI is a specific version of a project. For example, the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">requests</a> project has many releases, like <em>requests 2.10</em> and <em>requests 1.2.1</em>. A release consists of one or more <em>files</em>.</p>

      <p>A <em>file</em>, also known as a <em>package</em>, on PyPI is something that you can download and install. Because of different hardware, operating systems, and file formats, a release may have several files (packages), like an archive containing source code or a binary <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wheel/#files">wheel</a>.</p>


      <h3 id="installing" class="common-question">How do I install a file (package) from PyPI?</h3>

      <p>To learn how to install a file from PyPI, visit the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/installing/">installation tutorial</a> on the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.</p>


      <h3 id="publishing" class="common-question">How do I package and publish my code for PyPI?</h3>

      <p>For full instructions on configuring, packaging and distributing your Python project, refer to the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/distributing/">packaging tutorial</a> on the <a href="https://packaging.python.org">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.</p>


      <h3 id="accessibility" class="common-question">I am having trouble using the PyPI website, can you help me?</h3>

      <p>We take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility">accessibility</a> very seriously and want to make the website easy to use for everyone.</p>
      <p>If you are experiencing an accessibility problem, please <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">report it to us on GitHub</a>, so we can try to fix the problem, for you and others.</p>

      <h3 id="feedback" class="common-question">Where can I report a bug or provide feedback?</h3>

      <p>We welcome <em>constructive</em> feedback and bug reports via our <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">issue tracker</a>. Before writing a new issue, please first check that a similar issue does not already exist.</p>
      <p>If you report a bug, please provide as much detail as you can. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your operating system</li>
        <li>Your browser and browser version</li>
        <li>Whether you can reproduce the bug (does it always happen, or just sometimes after certain actions?)</li>
        <li>Steps to reproduce (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Warning or error messages (if applicable)</li>
        <li>What you expected to happen or your suggested fix (if you have one)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="contributing" class="common-question">How can I help?</h3>

      <p>We have a huge amount of work to do to continue to maintain and improve PyPI (also known as the Warehouse project), and would love to see some new faces working on the project.</p>
      <p>You <strong>do not</strong> need to be an experienced open-source developer to make a contribution - in fact, we'd love to help you make your first open source pull request!</p>
      <p>If you have skills in Python, HTML, SCSS, or JavaScript, then please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">issue tracker</a>. If you're interested in working on a particular issue, leave a comment and we can guide you through the contribution process.</p>

      <h3 id="preproduction" class="common-question">What does pre-production mean?</h3>

      <p>This is mostly just a warning at this point that the UI might return funky results, some things might not be great yet and to discourage throwing the full force of people's production traffic at it.</p>
      <p>The current hosting arrangement can't handle the full amount of traffic we get from <code>pip install</code> however uploads are fine and we're working on building on the new infrastructure with our future hosting arrangement that can handle the full production load.</p>

      <h3 id="project-name" class="common-question">Why isn't my desired Project name available?</h3>

      <p>When creating a new Project on PyPI, you may recieve an error from your publishing tool which indicates that a project is not able to be created with your desired name. In addition you may find that there are no associated project or release on pypi.org, currently there are three primary reasons this may occur:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The project name conflicts with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">Python Standard Library</a> module from any major version from 2.5 to present.</li>
        <li>The project name has been explicitly prohibitted by the PyPI administrators, for example <code>pip install requirements.txt</code> is a common typo for <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>, and should not surprise the user with a malicious package.</li>
        <li>The project name has been registered by another user, but no releases have been created.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="project-name-claim" class="common-question">How do I claim an abandoned or previously registered Project name?</h3>

      <p>There is currently no established process for performing this administrative task that is explicit and fair for all parties. However, one is currently in development with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a></p>

      <p>When <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a> is accepted, the project will create a workflow, to be documented here.</p>

      <h3 id="maintainers" class="common-question">Who maintains PyPI?</h3>

      <p>Warehouse is an open source project developed under the umbrella of the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) and supported by the Python Packaging Working Group (PackagingWG).</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/">PyPA</a> is an independent group of developers whose goal is to improve and maintain many of the core projects related to Python packaging.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG">PackagingWG</a> is a working group of the Python Software Foundation (PSF) whose goal is to raise and disburse funds to support the ongoing improvement of Python packaging.</p>

      <h3 id="sponsors" class="common-question">What powers PyPI?</h3>

      <p>PyPI is powered by a variety of tools and services provided by our <a href="{{ request.route_path('sponsors') }}">generous sponsors</a>.</p>
