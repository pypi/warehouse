        <h2 class="faq-title" id="Basics">Basics</h2>

        <h3 id="packages">{{ packages() }}</h3>
        <p>
          We use a number of terms to describe software available on PyPI, like <em>project</em>, <em>release</em>, <em>file</em>, and <em>package</em>. Sometimes those terms are confusing because they're used to describe different things in other contexts. Here's how we use them on PyPI:
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>project</em> on PyPI is the name of a collection of releases and files, and information about them. Projects on PyPI are made and shared by other members of the Python community so that you can use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>release</em> on PyPI is a specific version of a project. For example, the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">requests</a> project has many releases, like <em>requests 2.10</em> and <em>requests 1.2.1</em>. A release consists of one or more <em>files</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>file</em>, also known as a <em>package</em>, on PyPI is something that you can download and install. Because of different hardware, operating systems, and file formats, a release may have several files (packages), like an archive containing source code or a binary <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wheel/#files">wheel</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="installing">{{ installing() }}</h3>
        <p>
          To learn how to install a file from PyPI, visit the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/installing/">installation tutorial</a> on the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="publishing">{{ publishing() }}</h3>
        <p>
          For full instructions on configuring, packaging and distributing your Python project, refer to the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/distributing/">packaging tutorial</a> on the <a href="https://packaging.python.org">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="verified-email">{{ verified_email() }}</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, PyPI requires a verified email address to perform the following operations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Register a new Project</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The list of activities that require a verified email address is likely to grow over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy will allow us to enforce a key policy of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a> (once accepted) regarding maintainer reachability. It also reduces the viability of spam attacks to create many accounts in an automated fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can manage your account's email addresses in your <a href="{{ request.route_path('manage.account') }}">Profile</a>. This also allows for sending a new confirmation email for users who signed up in the past, before we began enforcing this policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="faq-group" id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating</h2>

        <h3 id="APIs">{{ APIs() }}</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, including RSS feeds of new packages and new releases. <a href="https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/">Please see the API reference.</a>
        </p>

        <h3 id="mirroring">{{ mirroring() }}</h3>
        <p>
          If you need to run your own mirror of PyPI, the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bandersnatch/">bandersnatch project</a> is the recommended solution. Note that the storage requirements for a PyPI mirror would exceed 1 terabyteâ€”and growing!
      </section>

      <section class="faq-group" id="problems">

        <h2>Problems</h2>

        <h3 id="login-problem">{{ login_problem() }}</h3>
        <p>
          You should be able to <a href="{{ request.route_path('accounts.reset-password') }}">reset your password</a> on the site; you'll receive an email with a password reset link. If you no longer have access to the email address associated with your account, <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">report it to us on GitHub</a>, so we can try to help.
        </p>
        {{ code_of_conduct() }}

        <h3 id="accessibility">{{ accessibility() }}</h3>
        <p>
          We take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility">accessibility</a> very seriously and want to make the website easy to use for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are experiencing an accessibility problem, please <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">report it to us on GitHub</a>, so we can try to fix the problem, for you and others.
        </p>
        {{ code_of_conduct() }}

        <h3 id="uploading">{{ uploading() }}</h3>
        <p>
          This feature was deprecated with the new version of PyPI - we instead recommend that you <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi">use twine to upload your project to PyPI</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="private-indices">{{ private_indices() }}</h3>
        <p>
          PyPI does not support publishing private packages. If you need to publish your private package to a package index, the recommended solution is to run your own deployment of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/devpi/">devpi project</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="project-name">{{ project_name() }}</h3>
        <p>
          When creating a new Project on PyPI, you may recieve an error from your publishing tool which indicates that a project is not able to be created with your desired name. In addition, you may find that there is no associated project or release on pypi.org. Currently, there are three primary reasons this may occur:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The project name conflicts with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">Python Standard Library</a> module from any major version from 2.5 to present.
          </li>
          <li>
            The project name has been explicitly prohibited by the PyPI administrators. For example, <code>pip install requirements.txt</code> is a common typo for <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>, and should not surprise the user with a malicious package.
          </li>
          <li>
            The project name has been registered by another user, but no releases have been created.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="project-name-claim">{{ project_name_claim() }}</h3>
        <p>
          There is currently no established process for performing this administrative task that is explicit and fair for all parties. However, one is currently in development with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a> is accepted, the project will create a workflow, which will be documented here.
        </p>

        <h3 id="file-size-limit">{{ file_size_limit() }}</h3>
        <p>
          If you can't upload your project's release to PyPI because you're hitting the upload file size limit, we can sometimes increase your limit. Please make sure you've uploaded at least one release for the project that's <i>under</i> the limit (a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#developmental-releases">developmental release version number</a> is fine). Then, please <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/new">file an issue</a> and tell us:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the project</li>
          <li>The size of your release, in megabytes</li>
          <li>Which index/indexes you need the increase for (PyPI, Test PyPI, or both)</li>
        </ul>
        {{ code_of_conduct() }}

        <h3 id="admin-intervention">{{ admin_intervention() }}</h3>
        <p>
          Spammers return to PyPI with some regularity hoping to place their Search Engine Optimized phishing, scam, and click-farming content on the site. Since PyPI allows for indexing of the Long Description and other data related to projects and has a generally solid search reputation, it is a prime target.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the PyPI administrators are overwhelmed by spam <b>or</b> determine that there is some other threat to PyPI, new user registration and/or new project registration may be disabled. Check <a href="https://status.python.org">our status page</a> for more details, as we'll likely have updated it with reasoning for the intervention.
        </p>

        <h3 id="file-name-reuse">{{ file_name_reuse() }}</h3>
        <p>
          PyPI will return these errors for one of these reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Filename has been used and file exists</li>
          <li>Filename has been used but file no longer exists</li>
          <li>A file with the exact same content exists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          PyPI does not allow for a filename to be reused, even once a project has been deleted and recreated.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid this situation, <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/">use Test PyPI to perform and check your upload first</a>, before uploading to <a href="https://pypi.org">pypi.org</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="feedback">{{ feedback() }}</h3>
        <p>
          We welcome <em>constructive</em> feedback and bug reports via our <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">issue tracker</a>. Before writing a new issue, please first check that a similar issue does not already exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you report a bug, please provide as much detail as you can. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your operating system</li>
          <li>Your browser and browser version</li>
          <li>Whether you can reproduce the bug (does it always happen, or just sometimes after certain actions?)</li>
          <li>Steps to reproduce (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Warning or error messages (if applicable)</li>
          <li>What you expected to happen or your suggested fix (if you have one)</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="faq-group" id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>

        <h3 id="maintainers">{{ maintainers() }}</h3>
        <p>
          The new PyPI is powered by the Warehouse project; <a href="http://warehouse.readthedocs.io/">Warehouse</a> is an open source project developed under the umbrella of the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) and supported by the Python Packaging Working Group (PackagingWG).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/">PyPA</a> is an independent group of developers whose goal is to improve and maintain many of the core projects related to Python packaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG">PackagingWG</a> is a working group of the Python Software Foundation (PSF) whose goal is to raise and disburse funds to support the ongoing improvement of Python packaging. Most recently it <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-psf-awarded-moss-grant-pypi.html">secured a grant from Mozilla</a> whose funding currently enables Warehouse maintainers to work on the new PyPI.
        </p>

        <h3 id="sponsors">{{ sponsors() }}</h3>
        <p>
          PyPI is powered by <a href="http://warehouse.readthedocs.io/">Warehouse</a> and by a variety of tools and services provided by our <a href="{{ request.route_path('sponsors') }}">generous sponsors</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="availability">{{ availability() }}</h3>
        <p>
          PyPI is heavily cached and distributed via CDN thanks to our sponsor <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> and thus is generally available globally. However, as could be expected for a giant distributed system, things can and sometimes do go wrong. If you have high availability requirements for your package index, consider either a <a href="#mirroring">mirror</a> or a <a href="#private-indices">private index</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="preproduction">{{ preproduction() }}</h3>
        <p>
          'Pre-production' indicates that you are using a version of this software that is not fully tested and 'production ready'. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The UI may return unusual or erroneous results</li>
          <li>Performance may not yet be optimised</li>
          <li>Some features that you use on the old interface may be missing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While we are in pre-production, our infrastructure cannot yet support all of the traffic generated by our users running <code>pip install</code>. We therefore ask that you do not use this version of PyPI for production codebases.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, uploads are working well, and project maintainers and owners should use this version of PyPI over the legacy site, which no longer supports this function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please see <a href="https://wiki.python.org/psf/WarehouseRoadmap">our development roadmap</a> to understand what features will be available next.
        </p>

        <h3 id="contributing">{{ contributing() }}</h3>
        <p>
          We have a huge amount of work to do to continue to maintain and improve PyPI (also known as <a href="http://warehouse.readthedocs.io/">the Warehouse project</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Financial</em>: We would deeply appreciate <a href="https://donate.pypi.org/">your donations to fund development and maintenance</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Development</em>: Warehouse is open source, and we would love to see some new faces working on the project. You <strong>do not</strong> need to be an experienced open-source developer to make a contribution - in fact, we'd love to help you make your first open source pull request!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have skills in Python, HTML, SCSS, or JavaScript, then please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">issue tracker</a>. We've created a <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">'Good first issue'</a> label - we recommend you start here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Issues are grouped into <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/milestones">milestones</a>; working on issues in the current milestone is a great way to help push the project forward. If you're interested in working on a particular issue, leave a comment and we can guide you through the contribution process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stay updated</em>: You can also follow the ongoing development of the project on the <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/distutils-sig">Distutils-sig mailing list</a> and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pypa-dev">PyPA Dev message group</a>.
