        <h2 class="faq-title" id="Basics">Basics</h2>

        <h3 id="packages">{{ packages() }}</h3>
        <p>
          We use a number of terms to describe software available on PyPI, like <em>project</em>, <em>release</em>, <em>file</em>, and <em>package</em>. Sometimes those terms are confusing because they're used to describe different things in other contexts. Here's how we use them on PyPI:
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>project</em> on PyPI is the name of a collection of releases and files, and information about them. Projects on PyPI are made and shared by other members of the Python community so that you can use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>release</em> on PyPI is a specific version of a project. For example, the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">requests</a> project has many releases, like <em>requests 2.10</em> and <em>requests 1.2.1</em>. A release consists of one or more <em>files</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>file</em>, also known as a <em>package</em>, on PyPI is something that you can download and install. Because of different hardware, operating systems, and file formats, a release may have several files (packages), like an archive containing source code or a binary <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wheel/#files">wheel</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="installing">{{ installing() }}</h3>
        <p>
          To learn how to install a file from PyPI, visit the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/installing/">installation tutorial</a> on the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="publishing">{{ publishing() }}</h3>
        <p>
          For full instructions on configuring, packaging and distributing your Python project, refer to the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/distributing/">packaging tutorial</a> on the <a href="https://packaging.python.org">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="trove-classifier">{{ trove_classifier() }}</h3>

        <p>
          Classifiers are used to categorize projects on PyPI.
          See <a href="{{ request.route_path('classifiers') }}">
            {{ request.route_url('classifiers') }}
          </a> for more information, as well as a list of valid classifiers.
        </p>

        <h3 id="verified-email">{{ verified_email() }}</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, PyPI requires a verified email address to perform the following operations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Register a new project</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The list of activities that require a verified email address is likely to grow over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy will allow us to enforce a key policy of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a> regarding maintainer reachability. It also reduces the viability of spam attacks to create many accounts in an automated fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can manage your account's email addresses in your <a href="{{ request.route_path('manage.account') }}">Profile</a>. This also allows for sending a new confirmation email for users who signed up in the past, before we began enforcing this policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="faq-group" id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating</h2>

        <h3 id="APIs">{{ APIs() }}</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, including RSS feeds of new packages and new releases. <a href="https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/">Please see the API reference.</a>
        </p>

        <h3 id="mirroring">{{ mirroring() }}</h3>
        <p>
          If you need to run your own mirror of PyPI, the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bandersnatch/">bandersnatch project</a> is the recommended solution. Note that the storage requirements for a PyPI mirror would exceed 1 terabyte—and growing!
        </p>
        <h3 id="project-release-notifications">{{ project_release_notifications() }}</h3>
        <p>
          PyPI itself does not offer a way to get notified when a project uploads new releases. However, there are several third-party services that offer comprehensive monitoring and notifications for project releases and vulnerabilities such as <a href="https://pyup.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pyup.io</a> and <a href="https://libraries.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">libraries.io</a>.
        </p>
      <h3 id="statistics">{{ statistics() }}</h3>
        <p>You can <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/">analyze PyPI download usage statistics via Google BigQuery</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://libraries.io/pypi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Libraries.io provides statistics for PyPI projects</a> (<a href="https://libraries.io/pypi/twine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example</a>, <a href="https://libraries.io/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API</a>) including GitHub stars and forks, dependency tracking (<a href="https://github.com/librariesio/bibliothecary/issues/415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in progress</a>), and <a href="https://docs.libraries.io/overview#sourcerank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other relevant factors</a>.</p>

      <section class="faq-group" id="problems">
        <h2>Problems</h2>

        <h3 id="login-problem">{{ login_problem() }}</h3>
        <p>
          You should be able to <a href="{{ request.route_path('accounts.reset-password') }}">reset your password</a> on the site; you'll receive an email with a password reset link. If you no longer have access to the email address associated with your account, <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report it to us on GitHub</a>, so we can try to help.
        </p>
        {{ code_of_conduct() }}

        <h3 id="tls-deprecation">{{ tls_deprecation() }}</h3>
        <p>
          Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is part of how we make sure connections between your computer and PyPI are private and secure. It's a cryptographic protocol that's had several versions over time. PyPI <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-announce-list/2018-April/011885.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned off support for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1</a> in April 2018 (<a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/01/time-to-upgrade-your-python-tls-v12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reason</a>). If you are having trouble with <tt> pip install</tt> and get a <tt>No matching distribution found</tt> or <tt>Could not fetch URL</tt> error, try adding <tt>-v</tt> to the command to get more information:
        </p>
        <p><tt>pip install --upgrade -v pip</tt>
        </p>
        <p>If you see an error like <tt>There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate</tt> or <tt>tlsv1 alert protocol version</tt> or <tt>TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION</tt>, you need to be connecting to PyPI with a newer TLS support library. The specific steps you need to take will depend on your operating system version, where your installation of Python originated (python.org, your OS vendor, or an intermediate distributor), and the installed versions of Python, <tt>setuptools</tt>, and <tt>pip</tt>. For help, please go to <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23pypa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the <tt>#pypa</tt> IRC channel on Freenode</a>, file an issue at <a href="https://github.com/pypa/packaging-problems/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pypa/packaging-problems/issues</a>, or <a href="https://www.python.org/community/lists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post to the python-help mailing list</a>, including your OS and installation details and the output of <tt>pip install --upgrade -vvv pip</tt>.
        </p>
        {{ code_of_conduct() }}

        <h3 id="accessibility">{{ accessibility() }}</h3>
        <p>
          We take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessibility</a> very seriously and want to make the website easy to use for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are experiencing an accessibility problem, please <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report it to us on GitHub</a>, so we can try to fix the problem, for you and others.
        </p>
        {{ code_of_conduct() }}

        <h3 id="uploading">{{ uploading() }}</h3>
        <p>
          In a previous version of PyPI, it used to be possible for maintainers to upload releases to PyPI using a form in the web browser. This feature was deprecated with the new version of PyPI – we instead recommend that you <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi">use twine to upload your project to PyPI</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="private-indices">{{ private_indices() }}</h3>
        <p>
          PyPI does not support publishing private packages. If you need to publish your private package to a package index, the recommended solution is to run your own deployment of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/devpi/">devpi project</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="project-name">{{ project_name() }}</h3>
        <p>
          When creating a new Project on PyPI, you may recieve an error from your publishing tool which indicates that a project is not able to be created with your desired name. In addition, you may find that there is no associated project or release on pypi.org. Currently, there are three primary reasons this may occur:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The project name conflicts with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">Python Standard Library</a> module from any major version from 2.5 to present.
          </li>
          <li>
            The project name has been explicitly prohibited by the PyPI administrators. For example, <code>pip install requirements.txt</code> is a common typo for <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>, and should not surprise the user with a malicious package.
          </li>
          <li>
            The project name has been registered by another user, but no releases have been created.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="project-name-claim">{{ project_name_claim() }}</h3>
        <p>
          There is currently no established process for performing this administrative task that is explicit and fair for all parties. However, one is currently in development per <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          PEP 541 has been accepted, and PyPI is <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/1506">creating a workflow</a> which will be documented here.
        </p>

        <h3 id="file-size-limit">{{ file_size_limit() }}</h3>
        <p>
          If you can't upload your project's release to PyPI because you're hitting the upload file size limit, we can sometimes increase your limit. Please make sure you've uploaded at least one release for the project that's <i>under</i> the limit (a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#developmental-releases">developmental release version number</a> is fine). Then, please <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file an issue</a> and tell us:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the project</li>
          <li>The size of your release, in megabytes</li>
          <li>Which index/indexes you need the increase for (PyPI, Test PyPI, or both)</li>
        </ul>
        {{ code_of_conduct() }}

        <h3 id="admin-intervention">{{ admin_intervention() }}</h3>
        <p>
          Spammers return to PyPI with some regularity hoping to place their Search Engine Optimized phishing, scam, and click-farming content on the site. Since PyPI allows for indexing of the Long Description and other data related to projects and has a generally solid search reputation, it is a prime target.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the PyPI administrators are overwhelmed by spam <b>or</b> determine that there is some other threat to PyPI, new user registration and/or new project registration may be disabled. Check <a href="https://status.python.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our status page</a> for more details, as we'll likely have updated it with reasoning for the intervention.
        </p>

        <h3 id="file-name-reuse">{{ file_name_reuse() }}</h3>
        <p>
          PyPI will return these errors for one of these reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Filename has been used and file exists</li>
          <li>Filename has been used but file no longer exists</li>
          <li>A file with the exact same content exists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          PyPI does not allow for a filename to be reused, even once a project has been deleted and recreated.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid this situation, <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/">use Test PyPI to perform and check your upload first</a>, before uploading to <a href="https://pypi.org">pypi.org</a>.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/">PyPA</a> is an independent group of developers whose goal is to improve and maintain many of the core projects related to Python packaging.

          As of April 16, 2018, PyPI.org is at "production" status, meaning that it has moved out of beta and replaced the old site (pypi.python.org). It is now robust, tested, and ready for expected browser and API traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
          PyPI is heavily cached and distributed via CDN thanks to our sponsor <a href="https://www.fastly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fastly</a> and thus is generally available globally. However, the site is mostly maintained by volunteers, we do not provide any specific Service Level Agreement, and as could be expected for a giant distributed system, things can and sometimes do go wrong. Please see <a href="https://status.python.org/">our status page</a> for current and past outages and incidents. If you have high availability requirements for your package index, consider either a <a href="#mirroring">mirror</a> or a <a href="#private-indices">private index</a>.

        <p>
          We have a huge amount of work to do to continue to maintain and improve PyPI (also known as <a href="https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/">the Warehouse project</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Financial</em>: We would deeply appreciate <a href="https://donate.pypi.org/">your donations to fund development and maintenance</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Development</em>: Warehouse is open source, and we would love to see some new faces working on the project. You <strong>do not</strong> need to be an experienced open-source developer to make a contribution – in fact, we'd love to help you make your first open source pull request!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have skills in Python, ElasticSearch, HTML, SCSS, or JavaScript, then please skim our <a href="https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/development/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Getting started" guide</a>, then take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue tracker</a>. We've created a <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Good first issue'</a> label – we recommend you start here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Issues are grouped into <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/milestones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">milestones</a>; working on issues in the current milestone is a great way to help push the project forward. If you're interested in working on a particular issue, leave a comment and we can guide you through the contribution process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stay updated</em>: You can also follow the ongoing development of the project on the <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/distutils-sig">distutils-sig mailing list</a> and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pypa-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyPA Dev message group</a>.
