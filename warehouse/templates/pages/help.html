      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <h3 id="installing" class="common-question">What is a package and how do I install one?</h3>

      <p>A 'package' in the context of PyPI is a bundle of software to be installed.</p>
      <p>Packages on PyPI are developed and shared by other members of the Python community so that you can use them in your own projects.</p>
      <p>To learn how to install packages, visit the <a href="python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing/">installation tutorial</a> on the <a href="python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.io/">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="publishing" class="common-question">How do I package and publish my code for PyPI?</h3>

      <p>For full instructions on configuring, packaging and distributing your Python project, refer to the <a href="//python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributing/">packaging tutorial</a> on the <a href="//python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.io">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="accessibility" class="common-question">I am having trouble using the PyPI website, can you help me?</h3>

      <p>We take accessibility very seriously and want to make the website easy to use for everyone.</p>
      <p>If you are experiencing an accessibility problem, <strong>please report it to us</strong>, so we can try to fix the problem, for you and others.</p>

      <h3 id="feedback" class="common-question">Where can I provide feedback?</h3>

      <p>We welcome <em>constructive</em> feedback. If you would like to suggest an improvement, please use our <a href="//goo.gl/forms/IaPbMVAKnYDP2xV92">feedback form</a>. Common feedback will be transferred to our issue tracker to be addressed by the development team.</p>

      <p>If you are experiencing a <strong>bug</strong>, please log an issue directly on our <a href="//github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

      <p>Please provide as much detail as you can. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your operating system</li>
        <li>Your browser and browser version</li>
        <li>Reproducability (does it always happen, or just sometimes after certain actions)</li>
        <li>Steps to reproduce</li>
        <li>Suggested fix (if you have one)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="contributing" class="common-question">How can I help?</h3>

      <p>We have a huge amount of work to do to continue to maintain and improve PyPI (aka the Warehouse project), and would love to see some new faces working on the project.</p>
      <p>You <strong>do not</strong> need to be an experienced open-source developer to make a contribution - in fact, we'd love to help you make your first open source pull request!</p>
      <p>If you have skills in Python, HTML, SCSS, or JavaScript, then please take a look at the <a href="//github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">issue tracker</a>. If you're interested in working on a particular issue, leave a comment and we can guide you through the contribution process.</p>

      <div class="callout-block">
        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> All users submitting feedback, reporting issues or contributing to Warehouse are expected to follow the <a href="//www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/">PYPA Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
