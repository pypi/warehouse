      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <h3 id="packages" class="common-question">What's a package, project, or release?</h3>

      <p>We use a number of terms to describe software available on PyPI, like <em>project</em>, <em>release</em>, <em>file</em>, and <em>package</em>. Sometimes those terms are confusing because they're used to describe different things in other contexts. Here's how we use them on PyPI:</p>

      <p>A <em>project</em> on PyPI is the name of a collection of releases and files, and information about them. Projects on PyPI are made and shared by other members of the Python community so that you can use them.</p>

      <p>A <em>release</em> on PyPI is a specific version of a project. For example, the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">requests</a> project has many releases, like <em>requests 2.10</em> and <em>requests 1.2.1</em>. A release consists of one or more <em>files</em>.</p>

      <p>A <em>file</em>, also known as a <em>package</em>, on PyPI is something that you can download and install. Because of different hardware, operating systems, and file formats, a release may have several files (packages), like an archive containing source code or a binary <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wheel/#files">wheel</a>.</p>


      <h3 id="installing" class="common-question">How do I install a file (package) from PyPI?</h3>

      <p>To learn how to install a file from PyPI, visit the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/installing/">installation tutorial</a> on the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.</p>


      <h3 id="publishing" class="common-question">How do I package and publish my code for PyPI?</h3>

      <p>For full instructions on configuring, packaging and distributing your Python project, refer to the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/distributing/">packaging tutorial</a> on the <a href="https://packaging.python.org">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.</p>


      <h3 id="accessibility" class="common-question">I am having trouble using the PyPI website, can you help me?</h3>

      <p>We take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility">accessibility</a> very seriously and want to make the website easy to use for everyone.</p>
      <p>If you are experiencing an accessibility problem, please <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">report it to us on GitHub</a>, so we can try to fix the problem, for you and others.</p>

      <h3 id="feedback" class="common-question">Where can I report a bug or provide feedback?</h3>

      <p>We welcome <em>constructive</em> feedback and bug reports via our <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">issue tracker</a>. Before writing a new issue, please first check that a similar issue does not already exist.</p>
      <p>If you report a bug, please provide as much detail as you can. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your operating system</li>
        <li>Your browser and browser version</li>
        <li>Whether you can reproduce the bug (does it always happen, or just sometimes after certain actions?)</li>
        <li>Steps to reproduce (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Warning or error messages (if applicable)</li>
        <li>What you expected to happen or your suggested fix (if you have one)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="contributing" class="common-question">How can I help?</h3>

      <p>We have a huge amount of work to do to continue to maintain and improve PyPI (also known as the Warehouse project), and would love to see some new faces working on the project.</p>
      <p>You <strong>do not</strong> need to be an experienced open-source developer to make a contribution - in fact, we'd love to help you make your first open source pull request!</p>
      <p>If you have skills in Python, HTML, SCSS, or JavaScript, then please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues">issue tracker</a>. If you're interested in working on a particular issue, leave a comment and we can guide you through the contribution process.</p>
