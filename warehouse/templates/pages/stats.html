    <p>
      We all love stats, so here are some useful statistics about PyPI.
      The statistics page is cached for 24 hours, so don't expect the
      numbers to be realtime.
    </p>

    <h2>Top storage users</h2>
    <p>Here is a list of the top 100 packages based on sum of their
    packages sizes (in bytes).</p>
