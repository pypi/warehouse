      <p>
        We all love stats, so here are some useful statistics about PyPI.
        The statistics page is cached for 24 hours, so don't expect the
        numbers to be realtime.
      </p>

      <h2>Top Storage Users</h2>
      <p>Here is a list of the top 100 pacakges based on sum of their
      packages sizes (in bytes).</p>

          <td>All of PyPI: </td>
