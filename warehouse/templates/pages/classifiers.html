    <p>Each project's maintainers provide PyPI with a list of "trove classifiers" to categorize each release, describing who it's for, what systems it can run on, and how mature it is.</p>
    <p>These standardized classifiers can then be used by community members to find projects based on their desired criteria.</p>
    <p>Instructions for how to add trove classifiers to a project can be found on the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#classifiers">Python Packaging User Guide</a>. To read the original classifier specification, refer to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0301/#distutils-trove-classification">PEP 301</a>.</p>
