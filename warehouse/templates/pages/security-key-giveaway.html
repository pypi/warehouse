      <p>
        In order to improve the general security of the Python ecosystem, PyPI
        has begun implementing a two-factor authentication (2FA) requirement
        for critical projects. This requirement will go into effect in the
        coming months, and more details are included below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, to ensure that maintainers of critical projects have the
        ability to implement strong 2FA with security keys, the Google Open
        Source Security Team, a sponsor of the <a
        href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>, has
        provided a limited number of security keys to distribute to critical
        project maintainers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eligible maintainers will be able to redeem a promo code for two
        free <a
        href="https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key">Titan
        Security Keys</a> (either USB-C or USB-A), including free shipping.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <p>Answers to frequently asked questions regarding this effort:</p>

      <h3 id="critical-eligiblity">What determines if a project is a critical project?</h3>
      <p>
        PyPI determines eligibility based on download counts derived
        from PyPI's <a
        href="https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/bigquery-datasets.html">public
      dataset of download statistics</a>. Any project in the top 1% of
    downloads over the prior 6 months is designated as critical.
      </p>

      <h3 id="critical-quantity">How many projects are designated as critical projects?</h3>
      <p>
        At the time of writing, there are more than 350K projects on PyPI,
        resulting in a 'critical' designation of more than 3,500 projects. This
        determination is recalculated on a daily basis.
      </p>

      <h3 id="optout">Can a project opt-out or become non-critical in any way?</h3>
      <p>
        No, once the project has been designated as critical it retains that
        designation indefinitely.
      </p>

      <h3 id="user-requirement-eligiblity">What users are included in the 2FA requirement?</h3>
      <p>
        Any maintainer of a critical project (both 'Maintainers' and 'Owners')
        are included in the 2FA requirement.
      </p>

      <h3 id="user-key-eligibility">What users are eligible to receive security keys?</h3>
      <p>
        PyPI users who are eligible to receive security keys must be
        maintainers of critical projects who have not previously enabled 2FA on
        PyPI and are able to ship their keys to an eligible region.
      </p>

      <h3 id="regions">What regions are eligible to receive security keys?</h3>
      <p>
        Titan keys are only approved for sale in certain geographic regions,
        and thus can only be shipped to the following countries: Austria,
        Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland,
        United Kingdom, and the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only use your response to this question to determine eligibility and
        do not store it or associate it with your PyPI account.
      </p>

      <h3 id="non-eligible-regions">What should maintainers in non-eligible regions do?</h3>
      <p>
        Unfortunately we are only able to distribute security keys to maintainers in
        eligible regions. If you are a maintainer of a critical project, and
        need to enable 2FA, but not in an eligible region, there are two options:
      </p>
      <p>
        Independently purchase a FIDO U2F security key from a security key
        vendor that is available in your region, such as
        <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" title="External link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yubikey</a> or
        <a href="https://thetis.io/" title="External link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thetis</a>.
        See <a href="{{ request.help_url(_anchor='utfkey') }}">How does two factor authentication
        with a security device (e.g. USB key) work? How do I set it up on PyPI?</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you should enable 2FA via a TOTP application instead. See <a
        href="{{ request.help_url(_anchor='totp') }}">How does two factor
        authentication with an authentication application (TOTP) work? How do I
        set it up on PyPI?</a>
      </p>

      <h3 id="key-quantity">How many keys are available?</h3>
      <p>A total of 4,000 keys are available to maintainers.</p>

      <h3 id="expiry">Do the promo codes expire?</h3>
      <p>The promo codes expire on October 1, 2022.</p>

      <h3 id="why-keys">Why security keys instead of TOTP-based authentication applications?</h3>
      <p>
        Using security keys via WebAuthn is generally considered to be more
        secure than using TOTP-based authentication applications for 2FA. For a
        more thorough analysis of the differences between TOTP and WebAuthn, see
        <a
        href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/06/20/getting-2fa-right-in-2019/">this
        article from the team who implemented 2FA on PyPI in 2019</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="why-two-keys">Why two keys instead of one?</h3>
      <p>
        Without multiple 2FA options, effect of losing a 2FA method results in
        the need to fully recover an account, which is burdensome and
        time-consuming both for maintainers and PyPI administrators. Enabling
        multiple 2FA methods reduces the potential disruption if one is lost.
      </p>

      <h3 id="promo-error">What should I do if I'm getting the error 'Promo code doesn't apply'?</h3>
      <p>
        Increase the quantity in the cart from 1 key to 2 keys. See
        <a href="#why-two-keys">Why two keys instead of one?</a> for more
        details.
      </p>

      <h3 id="supply">The key I want is not in stock, what should I do?</h3>
      <p>
        If the USB format that you want is not in stock in your region, you
        might consider using a USB-C to USB-A or USB-A to USB-C adapter with
        your security key.
      </p>
      <p>
        If no keys are in stock in your region, you might consider waiting to
        redeem your promo code until stock has been replenished (note that
        codes expire on October 1, 2022).
      </p>

      <h3 id="key-setup">I've got security keys already, what should I do?</h3>
      <p>
        See <a href="{{ request.help_url(_anchor='utfkey') }}">How does two factor
        authentication with a security device (e.g. USB key) work? How do I
        set it up on PyPI?</a>
      </p>

      <h3 id="contact">What should I do if I have a question that isn't answered here?</h3>
