{% trans username=username %}Hi {{ username }}!{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}
Earlier this year, we announced
that PyPI would require all users to enable a form of two-factor
authentication on their accounts by the end of 2023.
{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}
Keeping your PyPI account secure is important to all of us.
We encourage you to enable two-factor authentication
on your PyPI account as soon as possible.
{% endtrans %}

* {% trans %}What forms of 2FA can I use?{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}We currently offer two main forms of 2FA for your account:{% endtrans %}
{% trans utfkey="https://pypi.org/help/#utfkey" %}
- Security device including modern browsers (preferred) (e.g. Yubikey, Google Titan) {{ utfkey }}
{% endtrans %}
{% trans totp="https://pypi.org/help/#totp" %}
- Authentication app (e.g. Google Authenticator) {{ totp }}
{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}
Once one of these secure forms is enabled on your account,
to upload to PyPI you will also need to use either:
{% endtrans %}
{% trans trusted_publishers="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/" %}
- Trusted Publishers (preferred) {{ trusted_publishers }}
{% endtrans %}
{% trans api_token="https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken" %}
- API tokens {{ api_token }}
{% endtrans %}

* {% trans %}What do I do if I lose my 2FA device?{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}
As part of 2FA enrollment, you will receive one-time use recovery codes.
One of them must be used to confirm receipt before 2FA is fully active.

Keep these recovery codes safe - they are equivalent to
your 2FA device.

Should you lose access to your 2FA device, use a recovery code to log in
and swap your 2FA to a new device.
{% endtrans %}
{% trans recovery_codes="https://pypi.org/help/#recoverycodes" %}

{% endtrans %}

* {% trans %}Why is PyPI requiring 2FA?{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}
Keeping all users of PyPI is a shared responsibility we take seriously.
Strong passwords combined with 2FA is a recognized secure practice for
over a decade.
{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}
We are requiring 2FA to protect your account and the packages you upload,
and to protect PyPI itself from malicious actors.
The most damaging attacks are account takeover and malicious package
upload.
