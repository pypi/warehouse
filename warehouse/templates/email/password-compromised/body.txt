# What?
PyPI administrators have determined that your password is compromised. To
protect you and other users, we have preemptively reset your password and
you will no longer be able to log in or upload to PyPI with your existing
password.

PyPI itself has not suffered a breach. This is a protective measure to
reduce the risk for PyPI and its users.


# What should I do?

To regain access to your account, reset your password on PyPI
({{ request.route_url('accounts.request-password-reset', _host=request.registry.settings.get('warehouse.domain')) }}).


# How can I contact you?

For more information, you can email admin@pypi.org to communicate with the PyPI administrators.
