# What?

During your recent attempt to log in or upload to PyPI, we noticed that your password
has appeared in public data breaches. To protect you and other users, we have
preemptively reset your password and you will no longer be able to log in or upload to
PyPI with your existing password.

PyPI itself has not suffered a breach. This is a protective measure to reduce the risk
of credential stuffing (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Credential_stuffing) attacks
against PyPI and its users.


# What should I do?

To regain access to your account, you will need to reset your password on PyPI
({{ request.route_url('accounts.reset-password') }}). We also recommend that you go to
HaveIBeenPwned (https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and check your other passwords and get
yourself familiar with good password practices.


# How do you know this?

We utilize a free security service from HaveIBeenPwned. When registering,
authenticating, or updating your password, we generate a SHA1 hash of your password and
use the first five (5) characters of the hash to determine if the password has been
previously compromised. The plaintext password is never stored by PyPI or submitted to
the HaveIBeenPwned API.

For more information, see {{ request.help_url(_anchor='compromised-password') }}.
