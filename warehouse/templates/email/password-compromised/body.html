<h3>What?</h3>
<p>
  During your recent attempt to log in or upload to PyPI, we noticed your password appears
  in public data breaches. To protect you and other users, we have preemptively reset your
  password and you will no longer be able to log in or upload to PyPI with your existing
  password.
</p>
<p>
  PyPI itself has not suffered a breach. This is a protective measure to reduce the
  risk of <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Credential_stuffing">credential stuffing</a>
  attacks against PyPI and its users.
</p>


<h3>What should I do?</h3>
<p>
  To regain access to your account,
  <a href="{{ request.route_url('accounts.request-password-reset', _host=request.registry.settings.get('warehouse.domain')) }}">reset your password</a>
  on PyPI. We also recommend that you go to
  <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned</a> and check your other
  passwords and get yourself familiar with good password practices.
</p>


<h3>How do you know this?</h3>
<p>
  We use a free security service from
  <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned</a>. When registering,
  authenticating, or updating your password, we generate a SHA1 hash of your password
  and use the first 5 characters of the hash to decide if the password is compromised.
  The plaintext password is never stored by PyPI or sent to HaveIBeenPwned.
</p>
<p>
  For more information, see our
  <a href="{{ request.help_url(_anchor='compromised-password') }}">FAQ</a>. For help,
  you can email <a href="mailto:admin@pypi.org">admin@pypi.org</a> to communicate with
  the PyPI administrators.
