<h3>What?</h3>
<p>
  PyPI administrators have determined that your password is compromised. To
  protect you and other users, we have preemptively reset your password and you
  will no longer be able to log in or upload to PyPI with your existing
  password.
</p>
<p>
  PyPI itself has not suffered a breach. This is a protective measure to reduce the
  risk for PyPI and its users.
</p>


<h3>What should I do?</h3>
<p>
  To regain access to your account,
  <a href="{{ request.route_url('accounts.request-password-reset', _host=request.registry.settings.get('warehouse.domain')) }}">reset your password</a>
  on PyPI.
</p>


<h3>How can I contact you?</h3>
<p>
  For more information, you can email admin@pypi.org to communicate with
  the PyPI administrators.
</p>
