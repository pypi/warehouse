    An API token belonging to user {{ token_owner_username }} ({{ account_href }})
    was used to upload files to the project {{ project_name }} ({{ project_href }}),
    even though the project has a Trusted Publisher configured.
    This may have been in error.
    We recommend removing the API token and only using the Trusted Publisher to publish.

  {% trans href=request.route_url('manage.account'), token_name=token_name %}
    If you are the owner of this token, you can delete it by going to your API tokens
    configuration at {{ href }} and deleting the token named {{ token_name }}.
