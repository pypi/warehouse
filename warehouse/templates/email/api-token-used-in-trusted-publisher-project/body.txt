    An API token belonging to user {{ token_owner_username }} ({{ account_href }})
    was used to upload files to the project {{ project_name }} ({{ project_href }}),
    even though the project has a Trusted Publisher configured.
    This may have been in error.
    We recommend removing the API token and only using the Trusted Publisher to publish.

    If you are the owner of this token, you can delete it by going to your API tokens
    configuration at {{ href }} and deleting the token named {{ token_name }}.
