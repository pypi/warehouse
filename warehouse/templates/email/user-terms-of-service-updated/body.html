<p>
  Hello {{ user.username }},
</p>
<p>
  We're reaching out to inform you that we are rolling out an updated Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>
  Our new <a href="https://policies.python.org/pypi.org/Terms-of-Service/">Terms of Service</a>
  supersedes the <a href="https://policies.python.org/pypi.org/Terms-of-Use/">Terms of Use</a>
  that you agreed to when initially registering for, or by your continued use of PyPI.
</p>
<p>
  The primary reason for this updated document is to formalize our relationship with
  PyPI users, better establish the protections in place for PyPI and its users,
  and to enable us to move forward with new features and services.
</p>
<p>
  You may notice a banner on your next login reminding you of these updated terms,
  These terms will take effect for your account on March 27, 2025 and your continued use of PyPI
  after that date constitutes agreement to these new terms.
</p>
<p>
  You can read more on our <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-02-25-terms-of-service/">blog</a>.
</p>
