  An account recovery request was filed at {{ support_issue_link }} for the PyPI username {{ user.username }} which has this address ({{ user.primary_email.email }}) as its primary email.
</p>

{% if project_name %}
<p>
  In order to verify the request, please push a branch with the name {{ token }} to the public source code repository for the {{ request.route_url("packaging.project", name=project_name) }} project and respond to this email.
</p>

<p>
  The branch does not need to include any commits or changes and can be deleted after it has been verified.
</p>

{% else %}
<p>
  Because there are no projects with public source code repositories associated with your account, we are unable to utilize our normal verification process to proceed.
</p>

<p>
Please respond to this email confirming intent to reset 2FA.
</p>

{% endif %}

<p>
After that, {{ "and a 7 day waiting period," if not project_name else "" }} the 2FA for your account will be reset and a password reset will be issued to this address.
