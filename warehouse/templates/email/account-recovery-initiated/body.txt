An account recovery request was filed at {{ support_issue_link }} for the PyPI username {{ user.username }} which has this address ({{ user.primary_email.email }}) as its primary email.

{% if project_name %}
In order to verify the request, please push a branch with the name {{ token }} to the public source code repository for the {{ request.route_url("packaging.project", name=project_name) }} project and respond to this email.

The branch does not need to include any commits or changes and can be deleted after it has been verified.

{% else %}
Because there are no projects with public source code repositories associated with your account, we are unable to utilize our normal verification process to proceed.

Please respond to this email confirming intent to reset 2FA.

{% endif %}

After that, {{ "and a 7 day waiting period," if not project_name else "" }} the 2FA for your account will be reset and a password reset will be issued to this address.
