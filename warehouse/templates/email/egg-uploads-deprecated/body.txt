{% trans site=request.registry.settings["site.name"] %}During a recent upload of {{ project_name }} to {{ site }}, we noticed you uploaded an `.egg`/`bdist_egg` distribution file.{% endtrans %}

{% trans site=request.registry.settings["site.name"] %}{{ site }} is in the process of deprecating `bdist_egg` distribution file uploads, and will not accept them beginning August 1, 2023.{% endtrans %}

# {% trans %}What should I do?{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}Update your release tooling to cease upload of `.egg`/`bdist_egg` distribution files. If you are not already, and require binary releases, update your release tooling to upload `.whl`/`bdist_wheel` distribution files instead.{% endtrans %}
