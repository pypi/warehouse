  A Trusted Publisher for project {{ project_name }} ({{ request.route_url('packaging.project', name=project_name, _host=domain) }})
  was just used from a CI/CD job configured with a {{ publisher.publisher_name }} environment.
  The environment used was: {{ environment_name }}.


  Since the Trusted is configured to allow any environment,
  for security reasons we recommend constraining it to only one.


  If you are an owner of this project, you can automatically constrain this Trusted Publisher to
  '{{ environment_name }}' by following this link: {{ request.route_url('manage.project.settings.publishing', project_name=project_name, _host=domain, _anchor='constrain_environment-modal', _query={'constrained_publisher_id': publisher.id, 'constrained_environment_name': environment_name }) }}.


  Alternatively, you can do this manually by going to the project's
  publishing settings ({{ request.route_url('manage.project.settings.publishing', project_name=project_name, _host=domain) }}),
  deleting the existing Trusted Publisher and creating a new one with the environment set to '{{ environment_name }}'.


  If you have questions, you can email
  admin@pypi.org to communicate with the PyPI administrators.
