  <p>
    A Trusted Publisher for project
    <a href="{{ request.route_url('packaging.project', name=project_name, _host=domain) }}">{{ project_name }}</a>
    was just used from a CI/CD job configured with a {{ publisher.publisher_name }} environment.
    The environment used was: <strong>{{ environment_name }}</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the Trusted Publisher is configured to allow <strong>any</strong> environment,
    for security reasons we recommend constraining it to only one.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are an owner of this project, you can automatically constrain this Trusted Publisher to
    '{{ environment_name }}' by following this link:
    <a href="{{ request.route_url('manage.project.settings.publishing', project_name=project_name, _host=domain, _anchor='constrain_environment-modal', _query={'constrained_publisher_id': publisher.id, 'constrained_environment_name': environment_name }) }}">constrain publisher</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, you can do this manually by going to the project's
    <a href="{{ request.route_url('manage.project.settings.publishing', project_name=project_name, _host=domain) }}">publishing settings</a>,
    deleting the existing Trusted Publisher and creating a new one with the environment set to '{{ environment_name }}'.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have questions, you can email
    <a href="mailto:admin@pypi.org">admin@pypi.org</a> to communicate with the PyPI
    administrators.
  </p>
