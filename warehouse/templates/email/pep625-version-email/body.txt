This email is notifying you of an upcoming deprecation that we have determined may affect you as a result of your recent upload to '{{ project_name }}'.

In the future, PyPI will require all newly uploaded source distribution filenames to comply with PEP 625 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0625/). Any source distributions already uploaded will remain in place as-is and do not need to be updated.

Specifically, your recent upload of '{{ filename }}' is incompatible with PEP 625 because it does not contain contain the normalized project version '{{ normalized_version }}'.

In most cases, this can be resolved by upgrading the version of your build tooling to a later version that supports PEP 625 and produces compliant filenames. You do not need to remove the file.

If you have questions, you can email admin@pypi.org to communicate with the PyPI administrators.
