<h3>{% trans %}What?{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>
  {% trans site=request.registry.settings["site.name"] %}Since January 1, 2023, we noticed upload(s) of <code>.egg</code>/<code>bdist_egg</code> distribution file(s) to {{ site }} for {{ project_name }}.{% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% trans site=request.registry.settings["site.name"] %}{{ site }} is in the process of deprecating <code>bdist_egg</code> distribution file uploads, and will not accept them beginning August 1, 2023.{% endtrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans %}What should I do?{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>
  {% trans %}Update your release tooling to cease upload of <code>.egg</code>/<code>bdist_egg</code> distribution files. If you are not already, and require binary releases, update your release tooling to upload <code>.whl</code>/<code>bdist_wheel</code> distribution files instead.{% endtrans %}
