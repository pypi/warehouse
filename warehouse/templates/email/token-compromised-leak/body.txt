What happened?

{% set site_name=request.registry.settings["site.name"] %}

A third party ({{ origin.name }}) has informed us that a {{ site_name }} API token
associated with your account "{{ username }}" was found to be accessible at the
following public URL. We have automatically revoked this token.

{{ public_url }}

What should I do?

First, we recommend that you inspect the public page where the token
appeared. Please investigate whether this is the result of an error on your side or if
someone else acquired and published your token.

If the token was not published by you, it means it was stolen, either from you or from
someone with access to your account on {{ site_name }}. We urge you to take all the
necessary steps to secure all your credentials.

Once you have taken the applicable steps to ensure the token will not become public
again, you're welcome to generate a new one. Log into your account and head to your
profile page to create a new API token. You will need to update your existing
integrations with the new token.

Lastly, please review the releases of all your packages. You should make
sure a third party did not use your publicly accessible token to impersonate
you and release a malicious package.

How do you know this?

This is an automated message. Our partner {{ origin.name }} analyzes all the data it receives
for unintentional {{ site_name }} token publications and warns us every time it finds
one. We check every disclosure we receive and take action when the token appears valid.

For more information, see our FAQ at {{ request.help_url(_anchor='compromised-token') }}

For help, you can send an email to admin@pypi.org to communicate with the PyPI
administrators.
