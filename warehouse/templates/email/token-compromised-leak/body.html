<h3>What?</h3>
<p>
  A third party ({{ origin }}) has informed us that a {{ site_name }} API token
  associated with your account "{{ username }}" was found to be accessible at the
  following public URL. We have automatically revoked this token.
</p>

<p><a href="{{ public_url }}">{{ public_url }}</a></p>

<h3>What should I do?</h3>
<p>
  First, we recommend that you inspect the public page where the token
  appeared. Please investigate whether this is the result of an error on your side or if
  someone else acquired and published your token.
</p>
<p>
  If the token was not published by you, it means it was stolen, either from you or from
  someone with access to your account on {{ site_name }}. We urge you to take all the
  necessary steps to secure all your credentials.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have taken the applicable steps to ensure the token will not become public
  again, you're welcome to generate a new one. Log into your account and head to your
  profile page to create a new API token. You will need to update your existing
  integrations with the new token.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, please review the releases of all your packages. You should make
  sure a third party did not use your publicly accessible token to impersonate
  you and release a malicious package.
</p>
<h3>How do you know this?</h3>
<p>
  This is an automated message. Our partner {{ origin }} analyzes all the data it
  receives for unintentional {{ site_name }} token publications and warns us every time
  it finds one. We check every disclosure we recieve and take action when the token
  appears
  valid.
