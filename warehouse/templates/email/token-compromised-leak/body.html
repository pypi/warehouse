<h3>What?</h3>
<p>A third party ({{ origin }})
has informed us that a {{ site_name }} API token associated
with your account "{{ username }}" was found to be accessible at the following
public url. We have revoked this token.</p>

<p><a href="{{ public_url }}">{{ public_url }}</a></p>

<h3>What should I do?</h3>
<p>
  First, we recommend that you inspect the public page where the token
  appeared. Please investigate whether this is the result of an error on your side or if
  someone else acquired and published your token.
</p>
<p>
  If the token was not published by you, it means it was stolen, either from
  you or from {{ site_name }}. We urge you to take all the necessary steps to secure all your
  credentials.
  In the case of a breach of the {{ site_name }} database, you will find informations
  and support in the <a href="https://python-security.readthedocs.io/packages.html#vulnerabilites-in-the-package-index">python-security</a> documentation.
  In case of doubt, you can email <a href="mailto:admin@pypi.org">admin@pypi.org</a> to communicate with the PyPI administrators.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have taken the applicable steps to ensure the token will not leak again,
  you're welcome to generate a new one. Log into your account and head to your profile
  page to create a new API token. You will need to update your existing integrations
  with the new token.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, please review the releases of all your packages. You should make
  sure a third party did not use your publicly accessible token to impersonate
  you and release a malicious package.
</p>
<h3>How do you know this?</h3>
<p>
  This is an automated message. Our partner {{ origin }} analyzes all the
  contents it recieves for potential {{ site_name }} token leaks and warns us every time it finds one.
  We check every disclosure we recieve and take action when the token appears valid.
