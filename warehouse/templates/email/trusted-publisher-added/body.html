<p>
  PyPI user <strong>{{ username }}</strong> has added a new trusted
  publisher to a project (<strong>{{project_name}}</strong>) that you manage.
  Trusted publishers act as trusted users and can create project releases
  automatically.
</p>

<p>
  Publisher information:
  <ul>
    <li>Publisher name: {{ publisher.publisher_name }}</li>
    {% if publisher.publisher_name == "GitHub" %}
      <li>Workflow: {{ publisher }}</li>
      <li>Owner: {{ publisher.repository_owner }}</li>
      <li>Repository: {{ publisher.repository_name }}</li>
      {% if publisher.environment %}
        <li>Environment: {{ publisher.environment }}</li>
      {% endif %}
    {% elif publisher.publisher_name == "Google" %}
      <li>Email: {{ publisher.email }}</li>
      {% if publisher.sub %}
        <li>Subject: {{ publisher.sub }}</li>
      {% endif %}
    {% elif publisher.publisher_name == "ActiveState" %}
      <li>ActiveState Project URL: {{ publisher.publisher_url }}</li>
      <li>Organization: {{ publisher.organization }}</li>
      <li>ActiveState Project name: {{ publisher.activestate_project_name }}</li>
      <li>Actor: {{ publisher.actor }}</li>
    {% endif %}
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  If you did not make this change and you think it was made maliciously, you can
  remove it from the project via the "Publishing" tab on the project's page.
</p>

<p>
  If you are unable to revert the change and need to do so, you can email
  <a href="mailto:admin@pypi.org">admin@pypi.org</a> to communicate with the PyPI
  administrators.
