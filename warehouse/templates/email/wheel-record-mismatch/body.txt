This email is notifying you of an upcoming deprecation that we have determined may affect you as a result of your recent upload to '{{ project_name }}'.

Specifically, your recent upload of '{{ filename }}' has file contents that do not match the included RECORD file. In the future, PyPI will require the file contents of all newly uploaded wheel distributions to match their included RECORD file.

Any files already uploaded will remain in place as-is and do not need to be updated or removed.

In most cases, this can be resolved by upgrading the version of your build tooling to a later version that correctly records wheel contents. You do not need to remove the file.

Please read this PyPI blog post for more information: https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-08-07-wheel-archive-differentials

If you have questions, you can email admin@pypi.org to communicate with the PyPI administrators.
