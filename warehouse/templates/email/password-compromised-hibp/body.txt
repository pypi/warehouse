{% trans %}During your recent attempt to log in or upload to PyPI, we noticed your password appears
in public data breaches. To protect you and other users, we have preemptively reset your
password and you will no longer be able to log in or upload to PyPI with your existing
password.{% endtrans %}

{% trans url='https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Credential_stuffing' %}PyPI itself has not suffered a breach. This is a protective measure to reduce the risk
of credential stuffing ({{ url }}) attacks
against PyPI and its users.{% endtrans %}


# {% trans %}What should I do?{% endtrans %}

{% trans trimmed reset_pw_url=request.route_url('accounts.request-password-reset', _host=request.registry.settings.get('warehouse.domain')), have_i_been_pwned_url='https://haveibeenpwned.com/' %}
To regain access to your account, reset your password on PyPI
({{ reset_pw_url }}). We also recommend that you go to
HaveIBeenPwned ({{ have_i_been_pwned_url }}) and check your other passwords and get
yourself familiar with good password practices.{% endtrans %}


# {% trans %}How do you know this?{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}We use a free security service from HaveIBeenPwned. When registering, authenticating, or
updating your password, we generate a SHA1 hash of your password and use the first 5
characters of the hash to decide if the password is compromised. The plaintext password
is never stored by PyPI or sent to HaveIBeenPwned.{% endtrans %}

{% trans help_url=request.help_url(_anchor='compromised-password'), email_address='admin@pypi.org' %}For more information, see {{ help_url }}. For
help, you can email {{ email_address }} to communicate with the PyPI administrators.{% endtrans %}
