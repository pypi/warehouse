    Return a series of WHERE clauses against a given column that break it into
    windows.

    Result is an iterable of tuples, consisting of ((start, end), whereclause),
    where (start, end) are the ids.

    Requires a database that supports window functions, i.e. Postgresql,
    SQL Server, Oracle.

    Enhance this yourself !  Add a "where" argument so that windows of just a
    subset of rows can be computed.
