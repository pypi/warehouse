# Wheel platform checking

# Note: defining new platform ABI compatibility tags that don't
#       have a python.org binary release to anchor them is a
#       complex task that needs more than just OS+architecture info.
#       For Linux specifically, the platform ABI is defined by each
#       individual distro version, so wheels built on one version may
#       not even work on older versions of the same distro, let alone
#       a completely different distro.
#
#       That means new entries should only be added given an
#       accompanying ABI spec that explains how to build a
#       compatible binary (see the manylinux specs as examples).

# These platforms can be handled by a simple static list:
