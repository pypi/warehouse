/*
  A layout where the first child is split to the left, the second to the right.

  <div class="split-layout">
    <p>I will go to the left</p>
    <p>I will go to the right</p>
  </div>

  Modifiers:
    - middle: will align contents in the middle vertically
    - spaced: will add vertical spacing when the layout wraps
    - table: will use a table layout and align contents in the middle vertically
    - wrap-on-tablet: will wrap children once resolution is at tablet size
