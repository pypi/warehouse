  A dark, full width horizontal div that contains a short notification.
  Use for single lines only, as all content will be styled as a h3.

    <span class="notification-bar__icon">
      // icon here
    </span>
    <span class="notification-bar__message">
      // A one line notification goes here.
    </span>
  </div>

  Modifiers:
    - Warning: Applies a red background
    - Success: Applies a green background
