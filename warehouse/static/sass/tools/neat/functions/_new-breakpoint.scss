/// Returns a media context (media query / grid context) that can be stored in a variable and passed to `media()` as a single-keyword argument. Media contexts defined using `new-breakpoint` are used by the visual grid, as long as they are defined before importing Neat.
///
/// @param {List} $query
///   A list of media query features and values. Each `$feature` should have a corresponding `$value`.
///
///   If there is only a single `$value` in `$query`, `$default-feature` is going to be used.
///
///   The number of total columns in the grid can be set by passing `$columns` at the end of the list (overrides `$total-columns`). For a list of valid values for `$feature`, click [here](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1).
///
/// @param {Number (unitless)} $total-columns [$grid-columns]
///   - Number of columns to use in the new grid context. Can be set as a shorthand in the first parameter.
