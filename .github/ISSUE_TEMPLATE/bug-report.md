name: Bug report
about: Let us know if something is broken on PyPI

---

<!--
    NOTE: This issue should be for problems with PyPI itself, including:
    * pypi.org
    * test.pypi.org
    * files.pythonhosted.org

    This issue should NOT be for a project installed from PyPI. If you are
    having an issue with a specific package, you should reach out to the
    maintainers of that project directly instead.

    Furthermore, this issue should NOT be for any non-PyPI properties (like
    python.org, docs.python.org, etc.)
