about: Let us know if something is broken on PyPI
labels: ["bug :bug:", "requires triaging"]

<!--
    NOTE: This issue should be for problems with PyPI itself, including:
    * pypi.org
    * test.pypi.org
    * files.pythonhosted.org

    This issue should NOT be for a project installed from PyPI. If you are
    having an issue with a specific package, you should reach out to the
    maintainers of that project directly instead.

    Furthermore, this issue should NOT be for any non-PyPI properties (like
    python.org, docs.python.org, etc.)

    If your problem is related to search (a new or updated project doesn't
    appear in the PyPI search results), please wait for a couple of hours
    and check again before reporting it. The search index may take some
    time to be updated.
